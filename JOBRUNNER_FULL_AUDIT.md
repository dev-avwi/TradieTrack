## 1. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend (Web):** React + Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Wouter routing, TanStack Query
- **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native + Expo (Expo Router), NativeWind, Expo Location
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), WebSockets
- **External Services:** Stripe (payments), Twilio (SMS/Voice), Vapi.ai (AI voice), SendGrid (email), OpenAI (AI features), Xero/MYOB/QuickBooks (accounting)

### Data Model
- 158 database tables covering users, businesses, jobs, clients, quotes, invoices, time entries, locations, team members, forms, equipment, inventory, leads, automations, AI calls, and more.
- Multi-tenant architecture: every table has a `userId` or `businessOwnerId` foreign key for data isolation.
- Job-centric design: quotes, invoices, time entries, expenses, assignments, and forms all link back to a `jobId`.

### File Structure
```
server/routes.ts     ~48,000 lines  (all API endpoints)
shared/schema.ts     ~4,800 lines   (all database tables & types)
client/src/pages/    ~50 page components
client/src/components/ ~80 shared components
mobile/app/          ~40 screens (Expo Router)
mobile/src/lib/      ~15 service modules
```

## 2. AUTHENTICATION & ONBOARDING

### Authentication Methods
| Method | Web | Mobile | How It Works |
|--------|-----|--------|-------------|
| Email + Password | Yes | Yes | Standard bcrypt hash, session-based |
| Google OAuth | Yes | Yes | OAuth 2.0 flow via Google Cloud |
| Apple Sign-In | No | Yes | Apple ID integration (iOS only) |
| Xero Sign-In | Yes | No | OAuth for accounting-linked login |
| Passwordless Code | Yes | Yes | 6-digit OTP sent via email |
| Invite Code | Yes | Yes | 6-char alphanumeric code to join a team |

### Onboarding Flow (Owner)
**Step-by-step:**
1. **Role Selection** - Owner, Worker, or Subcontractor
2. **Trade Type** - Electrical, Plumbing, Building, HVAC, Painting, Landscaping, etc.
3. **Business Details** - Business name, ABN, phone, email, address
4. **GST Registration** - Toggle + default hourly rate
5. **Stripe Connect** - One-tap setup for accepting payments
6. **Data Import** - CSV import or migrate from Tradify/ServiceM8
7. **Team Invites** (Team plan) - Invite members by email
8. **Demo Data** - Option to seed sample clients, jobs, quotes
9. **Immersive Walkthrough** - "Life of a Job" tour through 7 stages

### Onboarding Flow (Worker/Subcontractor)
1. Register account
2. Enter invite code from their boss
3. See assigned jobs immediately

### Why It's Better
- Competitors (Tradify, ServiceM8) have no immersive onboarding. JobRunner walks users through the entire job lifecycle before they even create their first real job.
- CSV import from competitor platforms makes switching painless.
- Demo data lets users explore without risk.

## 3. DASHBOARD

### Owner/Manager Dashboard
**Web Display:** Full-width layout with KPI cards at top, widgets below
**Mobile Display:** Scrollable card-based layout optimized for one-handed use

**KPI Cards (top row):**
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Revenue | Sum of all paid invoices |
| Pending Revenue | Unpaid invoices outstanding |
| Jobs Today | Count of jobs scheduled for today |
| Active Workers | Team members currently clocked in |

**Widgets:**
- **Today's Schedule** - List of today's jobs with times, client names, addresses, status
- **Recent Activity Feed** - Real-time log of actions (job created, invoice paid, quote accepted)
- **What You Missed** - Notification summary panel (new leads, overdue invoices, team alerts)
- **Quick Actions** - One-tap buttons: New Job, New Quote, New Invoice, Add Client
- **Weather Widget** (mobile) - Local weather for outdoor trades
- **Active Timer** (mobile) - If a timer is running, shows elapsed time with job name

### Worker Dashboard
- Simplified view: today's assigned jobs, active timer, recent notifications
- No financial data visible (respects role permissions)

### Subcontractor Dashboard
- Only sees jobs assigned to them
- Accept/decline buttons on pending assignments
- Submit photos and notes

### How It Interconnects
- Dashboard pulls from `/api/dashboard/stats` which aggregates data from jobs, invoices, quotes, time_entries, and team_presence tables
- Clicking any KPI navigates to the relevant detail page
- Activity feed is real-time via WebSocket connection

### Call Handling Flow
```
Phone rings → Vapi AI answers
  → AI identifies caller intent
  → AI checks if caller is existing client (lookup_client tool)
  → AI captures details (capture_lead tool):
     - Name, phone, email, job type, address, urgency
  → If transfer mode:
     → Check business hours (isWithinBusinessHours)
     → Find available team member (transfer_call tool)
     → Transfer or take message
  → Call ends → end-of-call report webhook
  → System creates/updates Lead
  → SMS notification sent to owner
  → In-app notification created
  → Call logged with transcript, recording, cost
```

## 29. HONEST ASSESSMENT & GAPS

### Strengths
1. **Feature density is exceptional.** More features than any single competitor at a lower price point.
2. **AI integration is genuinely useful,** not gimmicky. Receipt scanning, quote generation, hazard detection, and AI receptionist all solve real pain points.
3. **Mobile-first done right.** The mobile app has feature parity with web for field operations.
4. **Australian-specific.** ABN, GST, QBCC, SafeWork compliance built-in from the start.
5. **Privacy-conscious GPS.** Ghost mode, opt-out, and work hours controls are ahead of the market.
6. **End-to-end flow is complete.** Lead → Job → Quote → Invoice → Payment → Receipt → Review is fully automated.

### Areas That Need Attention

**Architecture:**
- `server/routes.ts` is ~48,000 lines in a single file. This is a maintenance risk. Should be split into domain-specific route files.
- `IS_BETA = true` bypasses all subscription checks. Must be set to `false` before charging customers.
- Vapi webhook lacks signature verification when `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set.

**Feature Completeness:**
- **Tap-to-Pay** is stubbed out on mobile pending Apple production approval. Backend is ready.
- **MYOB and QuickBooks** integrations are planned but not implemented.
- **Offline mode** on mobile is limited. Some actions queue, but full offline-first architecture is not in place.
- **Search** is basic text matching. No fuzzy search or full-text search engine.

**Design & UX:**
- Some pages are information-dense and could benefit from progressive disclosure on mobile.
- Settings page has many tabs that can overwhelm new users.
- The "More" hub on mobile is a grid of icons that may not be immediately discoverable for new features.

**Testing:**
- No automated test suite exists. All testing is manual.
- No CI/CD pipeline defined.

**Documentation:**
- No user-facing help docs or knowledge base.
- No API documentation for potential third-party integrations.

**Scalability:**
- Single-server architecture. No horizontal scaling strategy defined.
- Background schedulers (10+) all run in the main process.
- WebSocket connections are in-memory (no Redis pub/sub for multi-server).

### What Should Be Prioritized
1. Set `IS_BETA = false` and run grandfather script before accepting paying customers
2. Add Vapi webhook signature verification
3. Split `routes.ts` into domain modules (won't change functionality but prevents maintenance nightmares)
4. Complete Tap-to-Pay mobile implementation when Apple approval arrives
5. Add user-facing help documentation
6. Implement basic automated testing
