Love where you’re at with this, honestly. You’ve basically built a *real* product now — this is the “tighten everything and launch” phase. Let’s do all of it.

I’ll give you, in order:

1. 🔧 **Replit master prompt** (copy–paste)
2. 📄 **Beta Launch PDF content** (you can drop into Canva/Docs as a PDF)
3. 💰 **Pricing page copy for beta**
4. 📧 **Marketing email to recruit first 3 testers**
5. 🎨 **UX polish checklist (iOS-style)**

## 1️⃣ Replit Master Prompt – “Make TradieTrack Production/Beta Ready”

Copy–paste this **entire block** into Replit AI for your project:

```text
You are reviewing a full-stack SaaS app called **TradieTrack**, built for tradies (plumbers, sparkies, carpenters, handymen) to manage:

- jobs
- clients
- quotes
- invoices
- schedule/calendar
- job chat & team chat
- file/photo attachments
- payments (Stripe + Stripe Connect)
- email notifications (SendGrid)
- business & team settings
- subscriptions (my platform billing)

I want you to act as:

- a **QA engineer**
- a **UX reviewer for tradies**
- and a **production-hardening engineer**

Your goal:  
**Make the app genuinely ready for a real BETA launch with real tradies.**  
No fake buttons, no “UI only”, no half-done features.

Please follow this exact plan:

────────────────────────
1. SCAN THE WHOLE CODEBASE
────────────────────────
- Scan all frontend routes/pages/components.
- Scan all backend/API routes / server functions.
- Identify all features related to:
  - Auth (login, signup, onboarding)
  - Business & user accounts
  - Jobs
  - Clients
  - Quotes
  - Invoices
  - Calendar / schedule
  - Job chat
  - Team chat
  - Files/photos
  - Stripe (subscriptions & Connect)
  - SendGrid emails
  - Settings (business, team, billing, payments)
  - Offline behaviour (caching/local storage, if any)

Create an internal map of how data flows through the app.

────────────────────────
2. VERIFY CORE BUSINESS FLOWS END-TO-END
────────────────────────
For each of these flows, check the code path, API calls, state updates, and error handling. Fix or improve anything broken, incomplete, or “UI-only”:

A) New tradie onboarding
- Signup → onboarding (business name, trade type, ABN, etc.) → dashboard.
- Ensure:
  - user is linked to a `business` record
  - default role is owner
  - sensible defaults (GST on/off, country, currency)
  - redirect always works (no stuck states)

B) Jobs
- Create job → attach to client → assign to staff → update status (New → Scheduled → In progress → Completed).
- Jobs should appear:
  - in Jobs list
  - in Calendar (if implemented)
  - in Activity/Today page
- Ensure status changes are stored in DB and reflected in UI.

C) Clients
- Create client → link to jobs, quotes, invoices.
- Ensure deleting clients is either:
  - blocked if linked to records, or
  - soft-deletes safely (no broken references).

D) Quotes
- Create quote for a client/job with line items, GST, totals.
- Implement/verify:
  - auto generated quote number (e.g. Q-1001 upwards)
  - clean PDF template
  - “Send quote” → uses SendGrid + generates PDF
  - public quote URL
  - acceptance flow:
    - “Accept quote” button on public link
    - store accepted_by, accepted_at timestamp
    - update quote status to Accepted
    - optionally convert to job/invoice

E) Invoices
- Create invoice (from quote or from job).
- Ensure:
  - invoice numbers auto-generate (INV-1001, INV-1002…)
  - ABN, business logo, client details are present
  - GST calculations correct
  - statuses: Draft / Sent / Paid / Overdue
  - “Send invoice” sends email with PDF and/or payment link.

F) Payments (Stripe)
1. Platform subscriptions (tradie → me):
   - Use Stripe in TEST mode.
   - Verify:
     - checkout sessions are created correctly
     - webhooks update business subscription status and tier
     - billing page shows correct plan and status
   - All keys must come from environment variables (no secrets in frontend).

2. Client payments (customer → tradie) via Stripe Connect:
   - Business connects Stripe via Connect onboarding.
   - `stripe_connect_account_id`, `charges_enabled`, `payouts_enabled` stored correctly.
   - Invoice payment link creates PaymentIntent using the connected account.
   - After successful payment (test mode), invoice status updates to Paid.

G) Chat (job & team)
- Job chat:
  - Messages belong to a job and a user.
  - Messages load in the correct job detail view.
  - Sending a message updates UI and persists to DB.
- Team chat:
  - Messages in a shared channel by business.
  - Basic working UX (no dead UI).

H) Files / Photos
- If implemented, verify:
  - upload endpoint works
  - files are linked to jobs
  - previews or file links show properly
  - only authorised users can see them.

────────────────────────
3. MAKE SURE NOTHING IS “UI ONLY”
────────────────────────
For every button, menu item, or tab in the app:

- Check if it actually performs a real action in the backend.
- For anything that is only UI but not implemented:
  - either complete the implementation, OR
  - clearly hide it or mark it “coming soon” (don’t leave dead buttons).

Examples:
- “Send quote” must actually send an email / store an event.
- “Mark as paid” must update DB and status everywhere.
- “Connect Stripe” must start a real Connect flow.
- “Attach file” must really upload + link.

The goal: **no fake features.**

────────────────────────
4. PRODUCTION / BETA CONFIG CHECK
────────────────────────
- All API keys (Stripe, SendGrid, etc.) are read from env vars.
- No secrets stored client-side.
- Role & auth checks on all sensitive API routes:
  - Users can only access data for their own `business`.
- If offline-support is included:
  - Make sure any local cache or localStorage is synced safely when back online.
  - Jobs/notes/quotes cannot be silently lost.

Add comments or config flags to differentiate:
- `BETA` environment vs full PRODUCTION.
For beta, it’s okay to run in test mode for Stripe and SendGrid.

────────────────────────
5. UX & UI POLISH (TRADIE-FRIENDLY, iOS-STYLE)
────────────────────────
Without changing the brand identity, please:

- Ensure all primary flows are reachable within **2–3 taps** from Home.
- Check mobile responsiveness for:
  - Home/Activity
  - Jobs list
  - Job detail
  - Quotes & Invoices
  - Calendar
  - Settings / More
- Remove any unused right-hand columns; center and properly size content containers.
- Add:
  - loading states for async actions
  - error messages (friendly, not raw errors)
  - confirmation toasts/snackbars for key actions (quote sent, invoice paid, etc.)

Keep texts simple and tradie-friendly, e.g.:
- “New job”
- “Send quote”
- “Mark as paid”
- “Take payment”
- “Attach photo”

────────────────────────
6. OFFLINE & CLOUD BACKEND SANITY
────────────────────────
If offline behaviour is implemented or partially implemented:

- Check that:
  - Creating/editing jobs offline is stored locally.
  - On reconnect, data and changes sync safely to the backend.
- Ensure there is a single source of truth in the database for:
  - jobs
  - clients
  - quotes
  - invoices
  - messages

If offline support is NOT implemented yet:
- Remove any misleading offline UI.
- Optionally add a simple “You’re offline” banner when network is lost.

────────────────────────
7. FINAL SUMMARY
────────────────────────
After all fixes and improvements:

- Produce a short summary (in comments or console output) listing:
  1. ✅ Core flows that are beta-ready (jobs, quotes, invoices, payments, chat, etc.)
  2. ⚠️ Areas that are still basic but okay for beta (e.g. simple calendar).
  3. 🛠 Clear TODOs for post-beta improvements (e.g. automations, scheduling board, deep reporting).
  4. 🎯 Whether TradieTrack is ready for:
     - A small private beta (3–5 real tradie testers).

Make sure the codebase reflects a **coherent, working, honest app** – not just a prototype UI.

Use my existing architecture and design, but polish it to be genuinely ready for real-world beta usage.
