Alright Ayden — here is the perfect MVP feature list for TradieTrack, crafted specifically so you can launch fast, impress early users, and avoid getting overwhelmed.

This is EXACTLY how the top SaaS founders plan successful MVPs:

Tier 1 → must build BEFORE launch

Tier 2 → build after real users onboard

Tier 3 → premium features that come later

I’m laying it out like a roadmap, so you know exactly what to build.

🧱 TRADIETRACK MVP (TIER 1)

🔥 If you build ONLY this, you can already charge $20–$39/month and compete with Tradify Lite.

✅ 1. Core Job Management (Launch Critical)

These screens MUST be perfect:

Create job

Job details

Add photos

Status (Quote → Scheduled → In Progress → Done)

Notes

Rules:

Should take < 5 taps to add a job.

Offline saving must work.

Instant photo upload (EXPO Camera).

✅ 2. Client Management (Simple)

Keep it minimal:

Name

Address

Phone

Email

Job history

Don’t overcomplicate with custom fields yet.

✅ 3. Basic Scheduling (Launch Critical)

This is just enough to be useful:

Assign job to a day

Assign to a technician (even if 1 user)

Calendar view (list or simple weekly overview)

NO drag-and-drop needed yet.
NO team calendar yet (that’s Tier 2).

✅ 4. Quotes (Simple but Fast)

Create quote

Add line items

Auto total

Convert quote → job

Don’t add:
❌ deposit invoicing
❌ materials catalogue
❌ saved pricing libraries
❌ multi-page quotes

Keep it simple and FAST.

✅ 5. Invoices (Basic)

MVP invoice should include:

Invoice number

Job description

Labour + materials

Total

Send via email

Not needed yet:
❌ payment gateways
❌ reminders
❌ deposit invoices
❌ progress invoices

✅ 6. Photo Upload + Before/After View

This is HUGE for tradies.

You NEED:

Quick photo capture

Photo gallery in job

Before/after layout

DO NOT worry yet about:
❌ markup tools
❌ drawing on photos

✅ 7. AI Feature (ONE ONLY) — MUST HAVE

Pick ONE AI feature for MVP:

Option A (best): AI job summary

User adds photos + notes

AI writes:

job description

invoice wording

report summary

Option B: AI quote item suggestions

User uploads photos

AI suggests materials/labour items like:

“Replace mixer tap”

“Labour 1hr”

DO NOT build both yet.
ONE AI feature is enough to make your MVP feel next-gen.

✅ 8. Instant “Create Job From Anything”

This is a cheat code for MVP success.

Allow job creation from:

Phone call notes

Copy/paste message

Voice note → transcribed

This becomes your viral moment:

“I can create a full job in 10 seconds from a client message.”

Neither Tradify nor ServiceM8 do this well.

MVP Deliverable Summary (Tier 1)

With Tier 1, you can launch + charge users.

MVP includes:

Jobs

Clients

Scheduling

Quotes

Invoices

Photos

1 AI feature

Offline mode

Sync

Push notifications (minimal)

This is enough to onboard your first 30–100 businesses.
