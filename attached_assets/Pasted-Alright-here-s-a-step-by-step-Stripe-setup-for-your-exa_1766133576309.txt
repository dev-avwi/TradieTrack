Alright — here’s a **step-by-step Stripe setup** for your exact pricing:

* **Pro = $39/month**
* **Team = $59/month + $29 per additional user (seat)**

I’ll keep it practical and in the right order.

---

# 0) Before you start (quick decisions)

### Currency

Use **AUD** (since you’re targeting Australia).

### Billing interval

Start with **Monthly only** (add annual later).

### Trials

Recommend:

* **7 or 14-day free trial** for Pro + Team
  (You can do “no card required” trials later, but easiest is card-required trial via Stripe.)

---

# 1) Create your Stripe account

1. Go to Stripe and create/login.
2. Complete the **Business details** (you can start as an individual/sole trader and update later).
3. Set **Payout bank account** (so money can flow).

---

# 2) Create Products + Prices (this is the core)

You’ll create **2 Products** in Stripe, with **recurring Prices**.

## ✅ Product A: “TradieTrack Pro”

1. Stripe Dashboard → **Products** → **Add product**
2. Name: **TradieTrack Pro**
3. Pricing model: **Recurring**
4. Price:

   * **$39.00 AUD**
   * **Monthly**
5. Save

### (Optional but recommended)

* Add a description like: “Unlimited jobs, quotes/invoices, AI job notes, single user”

---

## ✅ Product B: “TradieTrack Team”

Here’s the important part: **base + per-seat add-on**.

### Step B1 — Create the base Team price ($59/month)

1. Products → **Add product**
2. Name: **TradieTrack Team**
3. Price:

   * **$59.00 AUD**
   * **Monthly**
4. Save

This is your “Team base fee”.

---

### Step B2 — Create the “Additional User Seat” price ($29/month)

This is usually done as a **second product** OR a second price you attach in Checkout as an add-on.

**Recommended (cleanest): make it its own product:**

1. Products → **Add product**
2. Name: **Additional User (Seat)**
3. Price:

   * **$29.00 AUD**
   * **Monthly**
4. In advanced options:

   * Set it as **Quantity adjustable** (so you can do 1, 2, 3 extra users)
5. Save

Now you can charge:

* Team base ($59) **+** seats ($29 × number of extra users)

---

# 3) Add a Customer Portal (so you don’t build billing screens)

Stripe can host a portal where users can:

* change card
* cancel plan
* download invoices
* change seat quantity

### Setup:

1. Dashboard → **Settings** → Search **Customer portal**
2. Enable it
3. Turn on:

   * Update payment method ✅
   * Cancel subscription ✅
   * Update quantities (for seats) ✅
4. Save

This is a massive time saver.

---

# 4) Taxes (don’t overcomplicate)

For MVP:

* Don’t enable complicated tax rules yet unless you need GST immediately.

But if you want GST later:

* Stripe Tax can calculate it automatically (you can add it once you’re actually charging).

---

# 5) Checkout setup (the “upgrade” button)

Your app will send users to **Stripe Checkout**, where they pay.

### What you need for Pro

Checkout line items:

* Pro price → quantity 1

### What you need for Team (base + seats)

Checkout line items:

* Team base price → quantity 1
* Seat price → quantity = number of extra users

**Example:**

* 1 extra user → seat qty 1
* 2 extra users → seat qty 2
  etc.

Tip: In your UI, show:

* “How many extra users?” (+ / -)
* Total updates live.

---

# 6) The “unlock features” part (how your app knows who paid)

Stripe works like this:

* User pays
* Stripe sends an event to your backend called a **Webhook**
* Your backend updates your database:

  * `plan = "pro"` or `plan = "team"`
  * `seats = X`

### Webhooks you care about (MVP list)

* `checkout.session.completed` ✅ (user successfully subscribed)
* `customer.subscription.updated` ✅ (seat count changes, plan changes)
* `customer.subscription.deleted` ✅ (cancelled)

That’s enough.

---

# 7) Your internal “Plan Rules” (simple)

Store in your DB:

* `plan`: free | pro | team
* `seats`: number
* `stripeCustomerId`
* `stripeSubscriptionId`

Then gate features:

* Pro: 1 user only
* Team: allow number of users = `1 + seats` (or however you define it)

---

# 8) Test it properly (don’t skip)

Stripe has “Test mode”.

### In Test mode:

1. Create a checkout session
2. Pay with Stripe test card:

   * `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Confirm your app updates plan correctly

You’re not “done” until:

* cancel works
* seat quantity changes update correctly
* failed payment shows a warning (optional, later)

---

# ✅ Suggested “Minimum Billing UI” inside TradieTrack

You don’t need much in-app:

### Settings → Billing

* Current plan badge
* “Upgrade” button
* “Manage subscription” button (links to Stripe portal)

That’s it.

---

# 🔥 Your exact pricing logic (so it feels clean)

### Pro

$39/month

### Team

$59/month + $29/month per extra user
**Example text:**

> “Team starts at $59/month. Add staff for $29/user.”

Add a toggle:

* “Solo business” → Pro
* “Team” → Team + seats

---

## If you tell me what stack you’re using for the backend

I can give you the exact working code setup for:

* Node/Express
* Next.js (API routes)
* Supabase edge functions
* Firebase functions

But even without that, the Stripe dashboard part above is exactly how you set it up.

If you want the **next actionable step right now**, I’ll write you the **exact Stripe product names + descriptions** to paste in, and the **copy for your pricing page** that matches this billing model.
