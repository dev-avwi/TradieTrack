Got you.
I analysed all the screenshots, reconstructed the exact flow of your web app, and built a perfect Replit UI/UX master prompt that tells Replit exactly how everything should work and look when it builds the mobile app — feature-for-feature identical.

Below is:

✅ 1. Full Analysis of Your App (Story of the Screenshots)

This is extremely important because Replit needs this understanding for pixel-perfect UI/UX replication.

🔵 1. You start on the Dashboard (Light Mode)

Greeting (“Good afternoon, Luke”) pulls from auth user.

Beta badge + security badges (“GST compliant”, “Secure payments”, “Encrypted”).

Quick stats grid (Jobs today, Overdue, Quotes pending, This month total).

Bottom nav: Dashboard / Jobs / Map / More.

Floating action button (FAB) with star icon = create something (job/quote/invoice).

UX Purpose:

Give tradies a quick glance view. Nice spacing, soft card rounding, shadows, perfect for mobile.

🔵 2. Quote → Invoice Workflow

Screenshots show:

Quote preview

Full PDF-style layout

Client info

Job details

Items table

Totals

Invoice creation screen

“Loading accepted quotes…” loader

Client dropdown (with avatars + email)

Invoice details card

Live preview button

Preview renders full invoice in real time with branding, ABN, due date, tax, totals.

This is very ServiceM8-like.

UX Purpose:

Clear separation between Edit and Preview.

Live preview behaves like a PDF window inside the app.

Very strong for tradies because they can visualise final invoice before sending.

🔵 3. Client CRM Page

Total clients, search filters (phone, address, email).

Smooth cards showing counts.

Clean tags (“With Email”, “With Phone”).

Blue accent.

UX Purpose:

This is high-quality CRM UX. Very similar to Jobber & ServiceM8 but cleaner.

🔵 4. Subscription Page (Dark Mode)

Free vs Pro features

Dark theme matches the light mode exactly

Toggles, icons, spacing, everything consistent

UX Purpose:

Easy upgrade flow; visibility of locked Pro features.

🔵 5. Branding Page

App color selector

Custom color field

Live preview changes entire theme

UX Purpose:

This shows TradieTrack is white-label ready.
Huge selling point.

🔵 6. Notifications Panel

Simple, clean empty-state (“All caught up!”)

Icon animation

Slide-in panel from top right

UX Purpose:

It creates a sense of professionalism and reduces cognitive load.

🔵 7. Job Map Page (Dark Mode)

Mapbox or Leaflet dark map

Job pins grouped by status

Filters: All Jobs, “Jobs”, Legend

Pins with icons: document (quote), wrench (work order), green tick (done)

UX Purpose:

This is one of the strongest features — better than ServiceM8’s map.

🔵 8. Jobs Page

Filters: New, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Invoiced

Clear stats

“New Job” button

Recent activity area

UX Purpose:

Exactly how a tradie thinks about work: pipeline → progress → finalisation.

🔵 9. TradieTrack AI Panel

Slide-up modal from bottom

Auto suggestions

Job summary understanding

Smart assistant tone (“G’day!”)

UX Purpose:

This is a major differentiator.
Better than ServiceM8, Jobber, Tradify — none of them have this.
