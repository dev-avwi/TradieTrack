I don't know how it works but for mobile I still want to be able to collect payment through phone without stripe or is this a must I'm not sure just make it make sense for tradies and make sure the flow of jobs quote and invoices works with not only stripe but with all other payment options so ask by using what payment option do you want to use
Also clearly in the screenshots the collect payment doesn't work cause the page is saying stripe isn't connected but payment hub says it's connected I just want demos to work you know get just make sure everything's production ready
The themes isn't working in branding page this is mobile only I think, but like it isn't working as you can see I have green selected but it's not applying it doesn't give me option to apply
Also with time tracking and other things in the app the pages don't correlate in real time so like going from starting time in dashboard page it doesn't show up inside the job until later or whatever after or something
And this is same for time tracking page they all don't correlate in real time, cause as you can see a minute has gone past and the other two pages/showings of time trackings haven't syncs quick enough
Also when trying to convert a quote into invoice it doesn't work in that screenshot it says error invalid input
Also within viewing an item it says select template but clearly this isn't what the templates look like in template page, there's more options and stuff so whatever template you have applied or created, you can switch in and out of them. Make sure the exact same template is syncs with web exactly so that there's no inconsistencies cause this is very important cause of different platform adjustments so make sure it's exactly the same the items which is quotes invoices and receipts. Also generating/downloading a quote and invoice still don't work but for some reason receipt does and also why do the layouts of viewing a document look different between receipts and quotes/invoices as you can see in screenshots the receipt page shows more than the quote and invoice viewing pages
Also yeah just check mobile thoroughly and then web to make sure both clearly work together, also check for Xero syncing on mobile cause maybe web will work perfectly cause you can only test on web but make sure mobile correlates perfectly on all parts of web and is exactly the same and works well
