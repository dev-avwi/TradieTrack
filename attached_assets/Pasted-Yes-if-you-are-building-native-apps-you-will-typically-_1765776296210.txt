Yes, if you are building native apps, you will typically need both Xcode and Android Studio for development and publishing to their respective stores. 
Here is a breakdown of why each is necessary:
Xcode (for Apple App Store)
Required for iOS Builds: To build, sign, archive, and upload your app to the App Store, you need Xcode. It provides the necessary compilers, SDKs, and tools for the Apple ecosystem.
Platform Lock-in: Xcode is only available and functional on a Mac computer running macOS. There is no officially supported way to publish an iOS app without using Xcode at some point in the process.
App Store Connect: Xcode integrates directly with App Store Connect, where you manage your app's metadata, screenshots, and submit it for Apple's review process.
Developer Program: You must enroll in the Apple Developer Program (which costs an annual fee of $99 USD) to get the necessary certificates and access App Store Connect. 
Android Studio (for Google Play Store)
Primary Android IDE: Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Google's Android platform. It provides tools for coding in Java or Kotlin, debugging, performance profiling, and generating the necessary release files (App Bundles or APKs).
Image Asset Studio: As mentioned previously, Android Studio has a built-in tool to generate the various adaptive icon sizes and layers required for Android devices.
Google Play Console: You upload your app bundle to the Google Play Console, which is the backend where you manage your store listing, pricing, distribution, and submit for review.
Developer Account: You need a Google Play developer account, which involves a one-time registration fee of $25 USD. 
Alternative (Cross-Platform Frameworks)
You can use frameworks like Flutter or React Native to write a single codebase for both platforms. However, even with these, you still typically need: 
Android Studio to build the Android version and use its emulators/tools.
Xcode (on a Mac) to build and sign the final iOS package for submission. 
You can download both pieces of software from their official sources: Download Xcode and Download Android Studio.
Do you have your developer accounts set up for either store yet?
