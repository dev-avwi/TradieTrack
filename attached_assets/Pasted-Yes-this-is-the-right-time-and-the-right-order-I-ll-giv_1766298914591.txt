Yes — this is the right time and the right order 👍
I’ll give you a clear “do this now” checklist so you can publish without getting stuck or banned later.

⸻

✅ What to do RIGHT NOW (safe, clean, publishable)

1. Decide the legal owner (lock this in)

For this launch:
	•	Legal owner: your mum
	•	Brand: TradieTrack by A.V Web Innovations

This must be consistent everywhere.

⸻

2. Web app (publish this first) 🌐

Do this now:
	•	Publish the web app under tradietrack.com (or your domain)
	•	Footer text (copy-paste safe):

TradieTrack is a product of A.V Web Innovations
Operated by [Mum’s Full Name / Business Name] (ABN XXXXXXXX)

Include these pages (non-negotiable):
	•	Privacy Policy
	•	Terms of Service
	•	Contact / Support page

(Apple WILL check these.)

⸻

3. Web app monetisation (optional for now)

You can:
	•	Launch web app without payments
	•	Or add Stripe under your mum

If payments are not ready → don’t add them yet.
Apple doesn’t require web payments to exist.

⸻

4. Apple App Store (this is where people mess up — don’t)

Correct setup:
	•	Apple Developer account:
	•	Account Holder = your mum
	•	Email = developer@avwebinnovation.com ✅ fine
	•	App Seller Name:
	•	Either your mum’s business
	•	OR “A.V Web Innovations” if allowed
	•	App name:
	•	TradieTrack

In App Store Connect:
	•	Privacy Policy URL → your website
	•	Support URL → your website
	•	Developer contact email → your domain email

⚠️ Do NOT:
	•	Mention your age
	•	Say “student project”
	•	Say “personal app”

Just present it as a normal business app.

⸻

5. Google Play Store (easier)
	•	Use same branding + legal owner
	•	Same policy URLs
	•	Same contact email

Google is more flexible but still expects consistency.

⸻

6. ABN & business name — what NOT to do yet

❌ You do NOT need:
	•	Your own ABN
	•	A business name registration
	•	A trademark

Yet.

If anything is registered:
👉 it should be under your mum, not you.

⸻

7. This is the EXACT order I recommend

Phase 1 – Launch (now)
	1.	Publish web app
	2.	Publish iOS app
	3.	Publish Android app
	4.	Collect users
	5.	Fix bugs

Phase 2 – Validate
	6.	Add payments
	7.	Add paid plans
	8.	Get real customers

Phase 3 – Formalise
	9.	Register business name (optional)
	10.	Prepare trademark (later)

Phase 4 – Transfer (age 18)
	11.	New ABN
	12.	App transfer
	13.	Stripe migration

⸻

8. Final green light check 🚦

Before you press Submit:
	•	Legal owner = your mum everywhere
	•	Policies exist and link correctly
	•	Contact email works
	•	No fake info
	•	No age misrepresentation

If those are true → you are 100% safe to publish.

⸻

Final answer (straight up)

✅ Yes, this is the correct way to go
✅ Yes, publish web first, then mobile
✅ Yes, you can fix + formalise later
❌ No, don’t over-register things now

You’re launching like a real founder, not a school project — and Apple/Google will treat it that way.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Review your App Store listing text
	•	Check your privacy policy wording
	•	Give you a final pre-submission checklist
	•	Help you decide when to turn on subscriptions
