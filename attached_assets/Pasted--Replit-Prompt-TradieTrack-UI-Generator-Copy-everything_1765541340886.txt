🔧 Replit Prompt – TradieTrack UI Generator

Copy everything from here into Replit:

You are an expert React Native + Expo + TypeScript engineer and product designer.

Your task is to build the MVP UI for a mobile app called TradieTrack – an AI-powered job management app for tradies (plumbers, sparkies, etc.).

🔩 Tech + Project Setup

Use Expo and React Native with TypeScript.

Use Expo Router for navigation (file-based routing in app/).

Use functional components + React hooks.

Use StyleSheet.create for styling (no Tailwind).

Keep styles clean and reusable: define shared styles in a styles or theme file if helpful.

No backend or real API calls yet – just mock data + TypeScript types.

All state can be local or via basic context if needed.

🎯 UX Rules (Must Follow)

Apply these rules to every screen and component you build:

Clarity

Each screen must clearly show:

What it is (title at top)

What can be done

What the main next action is

Max 1–3 primary actions per screen.

Tap Limits

Common flows must be:

Create job → ≤ 3 taps from main Jobs screen

Add photos → 1 tap from Job details

Send invoice → ≤ 3 taps from Job or Invoice screen

Mark job complete → 1–2 taps

If a flow takes more taps, simplify the UI.

One-hand Use

Main actions (buttons) must be placed near the bottom of the screen where possible (thumb zone).

Large tap areas, no tiny icons only – always include labels.

Speed & Perceived Performance

Use skeleton loaders / placeholders instead of blank screens.

Use simple, fast lists. Paginate or fake-paginate when necessary.

Visual Hierarchy

Big, clear screen title.

Primary action button styled clearly (filled).

Secondary actions as outline/ghost buttons or simpler text buttons.

Use cards/sections to group related info.

Feedback

Every important action must give feedback:

Saved ✓, Job updated ✓, Quote sent ✓ (can be a toast or inline message).

Offline-Friendly UI (No real offline logic required yet)

Add an offline badge / banner component we can later wire up.

Design the UI so that actions can “queue” in concept (e.g., show “Pending sync” pill).

AI as Assistant, Not Boss

AI suggestions always editable.

Provide an obvious “Use suggestion” or “Insert” button.

🧱 Core Screens to Build
1. Jobs List Screen (app/index.tsx or app/jobs/index.tsx)

Purpose: Home screen for tradies.

Design:

Top area:

Title: Jobs

Small filter row: All / Today / Scheduled

List of jobs as cards:

Job title

Client name

Status pill (Quote / Scheduled / In Progress / Done)

Date & time

Location (subtle)

Each card is tappable → opens Job Details.

Floating primary button at bottom: “New Job”.

2. Job Details Screen (app/jobs/[id].tsx)

Purpose: See and manage a single job.

Sections:

Header:

Job title

Status dropdown/pill (tap to change status)

Client section:

Client name

Phone (tapable)

Address (tapable; placeholder for map)

Job info:

Date/time

Assigned technician (for later: show single user now)

Photos section:

Horizontal scroll of photo thumbnails

Button: “Add Photos”

Notes section:

Text area or read-only notes + “Edit notes” button

Bottom sticky bar actions:

Primary (filled): “Create Quote” OR “View Quote” (if exists)

Secondary: “Mark as Done”

Optional tertiary: “More” menu (for things we add later)

3. New Job Screen (app/jobs/new.tsx)

Purpose: Fast job creation in ≤ 3 taps from Jobs.

Fields:

Client selector / quick add (Name, Phone, Address)

Job title

Job description (multiline)

Date & time

Optional: quick toggle “Schedule later”

Buttons:

Primary: “Save Job”

Secondary: “Save & Open” (takes user straight to Job Details)

Add a small “Create from text” area:

Multiline input for pasted client message

Button: “Generate job details (AI)” (no backend – just mock)

4. Clients List (app/clients/index.tsx)

Purpose: See all clients.

Design:

Title: Clients

Search bar at top.

List of clients:

Name

Phone

Last job date

FAB: “New Client”

5. Client Details (app/clients/[id].tsx)

Sections:

Basic info:

Name

Phone

Email

Address

Actions:

Call

Email (placeholder)

“New Job for this client”

Recent jobs list (simple list of 3–5 jobs).

6. Quotes Screen (per Job) (app/jobs/[id]/quote.tsx)

Purpose: Create/edit a quote for a job.

Layout:

Header: Quote for [Job Title]

Client summary (name + address)

Line items list:

Each item: description, qty, unit price, total

Button: “Add item”

Summary:

Subtotal, Tax (placeholder), Total.

Bottom actions:

Primary: “Save Quote”

Secondary: “Send Quote” (no real send logic, just mock UI feedback)

Add an AI Assist panel (drawer or inline card) with:

Textarea: “Job notes”

Button: “Suggest quote items (AI)”

Display a static mocked list of suggested items the user can insert.

7. Invoice Screen (per Job) (app/jobs/[id]/invoice.tsx)

Very similar to Quotes, but:

Header: Invoice for [Job Title]

Line items (start from quote if exists – fake it for now).

Totals.

Payment status pill (Unpaid / Paid).

Actions:

“Save Invoice”

“Send Invoice”

“Mark as Paid”

8. Schedule Screen (app/schedule/index.tsx)

Purpose: Simple daily/weekly schedule view.

Design:

Toggle: Day / Week view (can just switch layouts for now).

List of jobs grouped by day.

Each job shows: time, client, status.

Tap → Job Details.

No drag & drop needed yet, but design it with spacing that could support it later.

9. Settings / Profile (app/settings/index.tsx)

Sections:

Business info:

Business name

Phone

Logo placeholder

Preferences:

Date/time format

Default tax rate (no logic yet)

Experimental:

Toggle: “Use AI suggestions” (no real logic needed yet; just mock state)

🧩 Components to Extract into components/

Create reusable components to keep UI consistent:

<Screen>

Wrapper with safe area, padding, optional header.

<PrimaryButton> / <SecondaryButton>

<StatusPill status="scheduled" | "quote" | "in_progress" | "done" />

<JobCard>

<ClientCard>

<SectionHeader> (title + optional action button)

<OfflineBanner /> (show mock “You’re offline, changes will sync later”)

<Toast /> or simple feedback mechanism (even just a simple temporary banner at top or bottom).

🧪 Dummy Data & Types

Create simple TypeScript types in a types.ts:

Job

Client

Quote

Invoice

Use mock data arrays for Jobs and Clients to populate the UI so the screens look real.

✅ What to Deliver

All screens under app/ wired with Expo Router.

Shared components in components/.

Consistent styling and spacing across all screens.

Dummy data to demonstrate full flow:

Jobs list → Job details → Quote → Invoice

Clients list → Client details → New job

At least one screen that demonstrates the AI assist panel UI (even if wired to static mock data).

Make sure the final result:

Builds and runs in Expo (no TypeScript errors).

Follows the UX rules at the top.

Feels like a coherent, production-ready prototype UI for TradieTrack.
