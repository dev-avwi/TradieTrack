✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-font
Required by: @expo/vector-icons
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install expo-font"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.
✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: @stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
