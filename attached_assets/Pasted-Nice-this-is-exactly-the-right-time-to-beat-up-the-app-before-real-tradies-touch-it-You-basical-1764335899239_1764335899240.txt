Nice, this is exactly the right time to “beat up” the app before real tradies touch it.

You basically want two things:
	1.	A manual test script you follow in the browser (using Replit’s preview URL)
	2.	A Replit AI test prompt that tells it what to inspect + fix in the code (including Settings)

I’ll give you both.

⸻

1️⃣ How to think about testing (simple version)

You’re testing 4 big areas:
	1.	Core flows – can a tradie actually do their job?
	2.	Settings – is their business set up properly?
	3.	Money – subscriptions + invoice payments (even in test mode)
	4.	Polish & safety – UI, errors, legit feel, no “school-project” energy

We’ll cover all of that.

⸻

2️⃣ Manual test script for you to run in Replit

Run the app in Replit, open the web preview, and follow this like a checklist.

A. New tradie signup & onboarding
	1.	Go to your sign-up page.
	2.	Create a brand new account as if you’re a tradie:
	•	Name: “Joe Smith”
	•	Business: “Cairns Plumbing Co”
	•	Email: use a realistic one (even if fake)
	3.	Complete onboarding:
	•	Business name
	•	Trade type
	•	Location (if you have it)
	•	Solo or team

✅ Check:
	•	Does it feel simple or overwhelming?
	•	Are there any fields that feel confusing or unnecessary?
	•	Do you ever feel “stuck” or unsure what to do next?
	•	After onboarding, does it land you on a sensible page (Dashboard or Jobs)?

⸻

B. Settings – Business + Email + Payments

Go into your Settings area and test each section.

1. Business Info
	•	Add:
	•	Logo
	•	Business name
	•	ABN
	•	Phone
	•	Email
	•	Address

✅ Check:
	•	Do quotes/invoices pull this info correctly?
	•	If ABN is empty, is there a warning message?

2. Email (verification / preferences)
	•	If you have email verification:
	•	Try “Resend verification”
	•	If not, just check:
	•	Does it show whether email is verified or not?

✅ Check:
	•	Do messages explain clearly what email verification is for?
	•	If email isn’t verified, does the app warn you before sending quotes/invoices?

3. Billing (your subscription)
	•	Go to Billing page.
	•	Pick a plan (Starter/Pro).
	•	Make sure it:
	•	Shows your current plan
	•	Shows upgrade button
	•	Shows status (active / trial / etc.)

(You don’t have to run a full Stripe test every time, just make sure the flow isn’t broken.)

✅ Check:
	•	Is it clear what each plan gives you?
	•	If you’re in “beta/free mode”, does it say that?

4. Payments (Stripe Connect)
	•	Go to “Payments” or “Accept card payments” section.
	•	Find the “Connect Stripe” button.
	•	Click it and check:
	•	Does it send you to a Stripe onboarding page (in test mode)?
	•	After you come back, does the app show “Connected / Verified / Active” or similar?

✅ Check:
	•	Is it obvious to a tradie what “Connect Stripe” does?
	•	Is there a clear explanation like:
“Connect Stripe to accept card payments on your invoices.”

⸻

C. Core business flows

Now pretend you’re a real tradie using this as your main app.

1. Create a client
	•	Go to Clients.
	•	Add:
	•	Name: “Sarah Thompson”
	•	Address
	•	Phone
	•	Email

✅ Check:
	•	Is it quick to add a client?
	•	Is anything weird or unnecessary?

2. Create a job
	•	Create a new job linked to Sarah:
	•	“Fix leaking shower”
	•	Set:
	•	Status: New / Scheduled / etc.
	•	Date + time
	•	Assign yourself (or a test tradie)

✅ Check:
	•	Does the job appear on:
	•	Jobs list
	•	Calendar (if you have one)
	•	Is it clear what the current status is?

3. Add job details
	•	Add:
	•	Notes (“Customer wants quote first”)
	•	Photo (if implemented)
	•	Files (if you support uploads)

✅ Check:
	•	Do attachments show clearly in job view?
	•	Does it feel organised, not cluttered?

⸻

D. Quotes & Invoices (legit feel check)

1. Create a quote for that job
	•	Add line items:
	•	“Labour – 2 hours @ $100/hr”
	•	“Materials – mixer tap”

✅ Check:
	•	Are totals correct?
	•	Is GST clearly calculated and labelled?
	•	Does the quote preview look professional?

2. Send quote
Even if you don’t actually send it (or use a test email):
	•	Click “Send” or “Share”.
	•	Check the email preview / confirmation modal.

✅ Check:
	•	Does it show a public link or PDF?
	•	Does the wording sound professional?

3. Accept quote (if you have public page)
	•	Open the public quote link (if available).
	•	Click “Accept”.
	•	Check:
	•	Does status change to Accepted?
	•	Does it auto-create a Job or Invoice?

4. Convert to invoice
	•	Turn the accepted quote into an invoice.
	•	Check:
	•	Invoice number format (e.g. INV-1001)
	•	Business details
	•	Client details
	•	Terms
	•	GST
	•	Total

✅ This is your “does this look like a real business document?” test.

⸻

E. Online payment (if wired)

If you’ve connected Stripe Connect (even in test mode):
	•	Open invoice as a client.
	•	Click “Pay now”.
	•	Use a Stripe test card (4242 4242 4242 4242 etc.) if you have a payment page.

✅ Check:
	•	After paying, does invoice status change to Paid?
	•	Does the app show a clear confirmation?

⸻

F. Job & Team Chat
	•	Open a job.
	•	Send a few messages in the job chat.
	•	If you have team chat:
	•	Send a general message there too.

✅ Check:
	•	Do messages post instantly?
	•	Is it clear who sent what?
	•	Is it easy to scroll?

⸻

G. Multi-user roles (if you’ve got them)
	•	Invite a second user (e.g., a tradie).
	•	Log in as that tradie (in another browser/incognito).
	•	Check:

✅ As tradie:
	•	Only sees assigned jobs
	•	Limited settings access
	•	No billing/plan change controls

✅ As owner:
	•	Sees all jobs
	•	Can manage team

⸻

H. UI & layout sanity check

On desktop and phone:
	•	Dashboard:
	•	Are widgets balanced (2x2 grid on desktop)?
	•	No big empty column on the right?
	•	Jobs list:
	•	Easy to read?
	•	Job detail:
	•	Not too cramped?
	•	Settings:
	•	Tab names clear?
	•	Bottom nav (on mobile):
	•	Easy to tap?
	•	Icons understandable?

If you see the “unused right column” issue, note which page and what you were doing.

3️⃣ What to ask Replit AI to test & fix

Once you’ve done your manual test and noticed issues, NOW you bring in Replit AI.

Here’s a prompt you can paste into Replit:

⸻

🧠 REPLIT PROMPT – “FULL APP TEST & HARDEN FOR PRODUCTION”

I’m building a SaaS app called TradieTrack for tradies (jobs, quotes, invoices, chat, scheduling, etc.).

I want you to act as:
	•	a QA tester
	•	a UX reviewer
	•	and a production-hardening engineer

Please:
	1.	Scan the entire codebase (frontend + backend + components + pages).
	2.	Identify all the key flows:
	•	sign up
	•	onboarding
	•	business settings
	•	jobs
	•	clients
	•	quotes
	•	invoices
	•	chat
	•	calendar/schedule
	•	billing (Stripe)
	•	payments (Stripe Connect if present)
	3.	For each area, verify:
	•	API calls are correct
	•	error handling exists
	•	forms validate inputs
	•	empty states are handled
	•	the right data is loaded from the database
	•	nothing is still using hard-coded mock data
	4.	Pay special attention to Settings:
	•	Business info (name, ABN, logo, email, phone, address)
	•	Email verification state
	•	Billing (subscription tier/status)
	•	Payments (Stripe Connect: account ID + charges/payouts enabled)
	•	Team management (roles: owner, manager, tradie)
	5.	Fix:
	•	any layout that uses an extra right-hand column or unused grid
	•	any inconsistent page container (pages that don’t match the layout used by the “More”/Settings page)
	•	any missing loading and error states
	•	any routes that don’t redirect properly after form submit (e.g. after onboarding, job creation, quote creation)
	6.	Check and improve the production setup:
	•	environment variables (remove hard-coded keys)
	•	API base URLs
	•	Stripe keys and webhooks are referenced via env variables
	•	SendGrid key is only used on the server side
	•	RLS/auth checks for all protected routes and queries
	7.	For quotes and invoices:
	•	ensure all required fields are present (business details, ABN, client details, numbers, dates, totals, GST)
	•	ensure totals and GST are calculated correctly
	•	ensure IDs are auto-generated and unique (e.g. Q-1001, INV-1001)
	•	ensure the preview / PDF output is clean and professional
	8.	For Stripe:
	•	verify subscription checkout session creation and webhook handling
	•	verify (if present) Stripe Connect account creation and account links
	•	verify that PaymentIntent creation for invoice payments correctly uses connect accounts and metadata
	9.	For SendGrid:
	•	verify that email sending functions use templates and do not expose secrets
	•	verify that app→tradie emails and tradie→customer emails are separated
	•	confirm Reply-To for tradie customer emails uses the tradie’s business email
	10.	At the end:

	•	list all important fixes you made
	•	list any remaining TODOs that must be done before inviting 3–5 real tradies as beta testers

Use my codebase as the source of truth and upgrade everything towards a stable, production-ready, tradie-friendly app.

⸻

You can run that once, let it refactor, then re-test manually with the checklist above.

⸻

If you’d like, next I can:
	•	help you create a “Beta Tradie Feedback Form” (so when you onboard your first 3 tradies, you know exactly what to ask), or
	•	write email texts for welcome / quote sent / invoice sent / payment receipt so your app feels super legit.
