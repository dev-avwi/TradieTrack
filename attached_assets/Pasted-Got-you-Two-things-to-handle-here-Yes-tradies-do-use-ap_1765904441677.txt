Got you. Two things to handle here:

Yes, tradies do use apps like Tradify daily — but they only switch if you nail reliability + accounting sync + simple workflow.

Here’s the exact Xero integration flow + a Replit prompt to implement + QA-check the full tradie journey (including owner/worker roles, map, chat, dispatch).

Do tradies actually use Tradify daily?

Yeah — the reason isn’t “the UI is pretty”. It’s because it becomes their daily operating system for:

jobs + scheduling

quotes → invoices → payments

client records + job history

bookkeeping handoff (Xero/MYOB/QBO)

team coordination

If TradieTrack does those without bugs, with clean PDFs/emails, and accounting sync, they’ll consider switching.

The biggest switch-killers:

syncing mistakes (double invoices, wrong GST, wrong status)

anything that feels “half built”

poor offline handling on site

hard onboarding / too many steps

Xero integration flow (the clean “TradieTrack → Xero” design)
Goal

Let tradies keep using TradieTrack daily, but Xero becomes the accounting backend.

What you should sync (minimum)

Entities

Contacts: Client ↔ Xero Contact

Items/Services (optional): TradieTrack service items ↔ Xero items

Invoices: TradieTrack Invoice ↔ Xero Invoice

Payments: TradieTrack paid status ↔ Xero Payments

Tax/GST codes: map correctly (critical)

Sync direction (best for MVP)

One-way as default: TradieTrack → Xero

Create/update invoices in Xero when user hits Send Invoice (or when “Approved”)

Create contacts in Xero when first invoicing a client

When Stripe marks invoice paid → push payment record into Xero (optional in MVP; nice to have)

Then later (Phase 2):
Two-way sync (Xero updates reflect back in TradieTrack)

If invoice marked paid in Xero, update TradieTrack

If contact updated in Xero, update TradieTrack

Rules to avoid disasters

Store xeroTenantId, xeroContactId, xeroInvoiceId on your records.

Use an idempotency key for invoice creation so you never duplicate.

Use a sync status on invoices:

not_synced → syncing → synced → sync_failed

Never “edit sent invoices” without creating a new revision / credit note path (or just block editing after “sent” in beta).

OAuth connection flow

Settings → Integrations → Xero

Owner clicks “Connect Xero”

OAuth consent (Xero)

User selects organization/tenant (if multiple)

Save tokens securely server-side (encrypted at rest)

Run “Test connection” + show green check

Optional: “Sync now” button

Invoice creation mapping

When TradieTrack invoice exists:

Xero Invoice Type: ACCREC

Contact: client

Line items: description, qty, unit amount

Tax: correct code (GST 10% for AU)

Due date: from TradieTrack

Status: Draft initially; set to “AUTHORISED” only when you’re confident (or keep Draft for MVP)

Payment mapping

When invoice is paid via Stripe:

Create Xero Payment attached to invoice

Use a clearing account (or let them choose in settings)

Record reference: Stripe payment intent ID

MYOB + QuickBooks plan

Same architecture, different connectors:

MYOB: similar OAuth + invoice/contact APIs

QuickBooks Online: OAuth + Customer/Invoice/Payment objects

Key point: build a single internal interface:
AccountingProvider = XERO | MYOB | QBO
and a common mapping layer so you don’t rewrite your whole app for each.

IMPORTANT: Your current build error (why EAS is failing)

Your EAS build is failing because react-native-reanimated wants react-native-worklets.

Fix it in /mobile:

npx expo install react-native-worklets
npx expo install --check


Then update the mismatched packages expo doctor flagged:

npx expo install expo-audio@~1.1.0
npx expo install typescript@~5.9.2 @types/react@~19.1.10


Re-run:

npx expo-doctor
eas build --profile development --platform ios


Also: Expo Go limitations you saw are real (notifications + background location). Use Development Build (which you already started doing) for proper testing.

Replit Master Prompt: Xero + “is everything real or UI-only?”

Paste this into Replit as ONE prompt:

Act as a senior QA engineer + backend integrator for TradieTrack.

Goal: Make TradieTrack a technically-solid beta where nothing is “UI only”.
You must verify every visible feature has real backend implementation and real data integrity.

PART A — TradieTrack Core Workflow QA (end-to-end)
Test and verify these flows are FULLY wired:
1) Auth + onboarding (owner vs worker vs admin role)
- Create an OWNER account and complete onboarding: business name, ABN, address, timezone, logo, GST settings, invoice footer.
- Create a TEAM and invite 2 workers.
- Verify roles change UI and permissions:
  OWNER: sees billing, integrations, team management, map, dispatch.
  WORKER: sees assigned jobs, time tracking, job chat, location share toggle (if enabled).
  ADMIN/MANAGER (if exists): sees scheduling + dispatch but not billing.

2) Jobs → Quote → Send → Accept → Convert → Invoice → Pay → Receipt
- Create job with real address + optional lat/lng.
- Create quote from job, check live preview updates, generate PDF.
- Send quote email (SendGrid): verify From, Reply-To, subject, attachment/link, and audit log.
- Client acceptance updates quote status + stores timestamp + optionally updates job status.
- Convert to invoice, send invoice email, verify PDF formatting and numbering.
- Stripe payment marks invoice Paid and triggers receipt email + updates timeline.

3) Offline / error handling
- For key actions: save job, save quote, send invoice, start timer:
  ensure loading states, retry, no crashes, and clear error messages.
- Ensure offline storage does not overwrite newer cloud data incorrectly.

PART B — Map Page + Location System (NOT UI text)
Implement and/or verify:
- Map page (OWNER/MANAGER view): Google Maps style showing:
  - job markers across region
  - marker color/status: Scheduled/In Progress/Completed/Overdue
  - quick details card on tap
- Jobs store:
  - formatted address
  - lat/lng if available
  - status
  - assigned worker
- Team locations:
  - workers can optionally share location (toggle)
  - backend endpoint stores last known worker location with timestamp
  - map shows worker pins separately from jobs
- “Open in Maps” deep link uses stored lat/lng or encoded address.

If any part is incomplete, hide it behind “Beta / Coming soon” and ensure the UI doesn’t expose dead buttons.

PART C — Chat System
Implement and/or verify:
- Team Group Chat (all members)
- Job Chat (per job)
- Direct Chat (owner/manager ↔ worker)
Requirements:
- messages persist in DB
- messages are scoped by permissions (workers cannot see other teams)
- notifications: at least local in-app badge counts, and push if dev build supports it
- attachments optional (v2) but message sending must be real (no mock UI)

PART D — Dispatch Board
Implement and/or verify:
- Dispatch board shows jobs by date/status/assignee
- Owner can assign/reassign jobs to workers
- Worker sees updates immediately (re-fetch or realtime)
- Role permissions enforced

PART E — Xero Integration (MVP)
Implement a real Xero integration flow:
1) Settings → Integrations → Connect Xero (OAuth)
- Store tokens securely server-side
- Select tenant/organisation
- Show “Connected” and “Test Connection” result

2) Data mapping rules:
- Client → Xero Contact (store xeroContactId)
- Invoice → Xero Invoice (store xeroInvoiceId)
- GST/tax mapping correct for AU
- Prevent duplicates using idempotency keys and saved Xero IDs

3) Sync triggers:
- When user sends an invoice, create/update invoice in Xero
- Sync status visible: not_synced / syncing / synced / failed with error details

PART F — “UI-only” detector
Scan the app for any navigation items, buttons, or pages that:
- don’t hit working API endpoints
- contain placeholder data
- have TODO or fake flows
Either implement fully OR hide for beta.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
At the end, produce:
- A list of every endpoint used by mobile/web and whether it is working
- A checklist of PASS/FAIL for each major workflow
- The MUST-FIX items before inviting real Cairns tradies
- The features safe to label “coming soon” without damaging trust

Real-world test script you can do on your phone (quick but legit)

Do this with two accounts on two devices (or one device + browser incognito):

Owner in Cairns City, Worker in Smithfield (or just pretend)

Owner creates job at a real address (e.g., “123 Sheridan St”)

Worker opens app and sees assigned job

Worker starts timer + adds a note + uploads a photo

Owner sees it on job timeline + map pin updates status

Quote + email test

Owner generates quote → Send to your own Gmail alias as “client”

Open on phone Gmail → check PDF and acceptance link → accept

Owner sees acceptance + converts to invoice → send invoice email

Payment test

Pay invoice in Stripe test mode → confirm “Paid” status updates + receipt email sends

If those 3 pass cleanly, you’re genuinely close to beta-ready.
