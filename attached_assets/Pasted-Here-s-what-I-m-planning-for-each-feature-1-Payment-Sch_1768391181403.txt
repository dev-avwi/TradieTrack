Here's what I'm planning for each feature:

1. Payment Scheduling (Recurring Payment Plans)
What it does: Allows tradies to set up installment payment plans for larger invoices (e.g., a $3,000 kitchen renovation paid as 3 x $1,000 monthly payments).

What I'll build:

Add a paymentSchedules table to track: invoice ID, total installments, payment amounts, due dates, payment status
Add API endpoints: create schedule, get schedule, mark installment paid
Add UI in InvoiceDetailView to set up a payment plan when sending an invoice
Auto-generate reminders for upcoming installment due dates (using existing automation system)
Track partial payments against the schedule
Files I'll modify:

shared/schema.ts - Add paymentSchedules table
server/storage.ts - Add CRUD operations
server/routes.ts - Add API endpoints
client/src/components/InvoiceDetailView.tsx - Add "Set up payment plan" option
2. Technician Utilization Metrics
What it does: Shows owners how efficiently their team members are being used - billable hours vs available hours, jobs completed per day, etc.

What I'll build:

New API endpoint /api/reports/utilization that calculates:
Billable hours (from time entries) vs working hours per team member
Jobs completed per day/week/month
Average job duration
Utilization percentage (billable / available)
Add a "Team Utilization" section to the existing dashboard or reports page
Show charts/metrics per team member with date range filtering
Files I'll modify:

server/routes.ts - Add utilization report endpoint
client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx or create a new Reports page section - Add utilization charts
Summary:

Feature	New Tables	New Endpoints	UI Changes
Payment Scheduling	1 (paymentSchedules)	3-4	Invoice detail + setup modal
Utilization Metrics	0	1	Dashboard section with charts
Both are relatively contained changes that build on existing infrastructure (time entries, invoices, automation).

Do you want me to proceed with both, or tackle them one at a time?
