Love this. You’re at the **“technically solid beta”** stage now – this is where you stop endlessly building and start **hardening + testing + launching small**.

I’ll give you everything you asked for:

1. ✅ One **Replit master testing prompt** (copy–paste ready)
2. ✅ **Beta Launch PDF** content (you can paste into Google Docs/Canva as a PDF)
3. ✅ **Beta pricing page** copy
4. ✅ **Marketing email** to recruit your first 3 testers

## 1️⃣ Replit “MASTER TESTING” Prompt (for a technically solid beta)

Copy–paste this into Replit AI:

```text
You are helping me ship a **technically solid beta** of my SaaS app **TradieTrack**, a job/quote/invoice platform for tradies (plumbers, sparkies, handymen) with:

- Auth + onboarding
- Business setup (ABN, logo, contact details)
- Jobs & clients
- Quotes & invoices (+ PDFs)
- Calendar/schedule
- Job & team chat
- File uploads (photos/docs)
- Subscriptions (Stripe)
- Customer payments (Stripe Connect)
- Emails (SendGrid)
- Role-based access (owner, staff)
- Dashboard / Activity view

I want you to act as:

- ✅ QA tester
- ✅ Senior full-stack engineer
- ✅ UX reviewer (thinking like a tradie)
- ✅ Production-readiness auditor

Your goal: make this app a **technically solid, internally testable beta** – not just pretty UI.

Please do ALL of the following:

────────────────────────────────
1. MAP CORE FLOWS & CONFIRM THEY WORK END-TO-END
────────────────────────────────
Find and inspect the code for these flows. For each one, verify the full path (front + back + database):

1) Auth & onboarding
   - Sign up
   - Login
   - Logout
   - Onboarding (business name, trade type, ABN, location, solo/team)
   - Redirect after onboarding (should end on a useful page, e.g. Dashboard/Activity)

2) Business settings
   - Update business profile (name, ABN, phone, email, address, logo)
   - Confirm these values are used in quotes/invoices PDFs and emails
   - Check validation & error handling

3) Clients & jobs
   - Create/edit/delete a client
   - Create/edit/update a job linked to a client
   - Job statuses: New → Scheduled → In progress → Completed → Invoiced (or similar)
   - Ensure status changes are persisted and used in UI filters

4) Quotes
   - Create quote for a client/job
   - Line items: description, qty, unit price, total
   - GST logic (on/off, calculations)
   - Auto quote numbers (e.g. Q-1001, Q-1002)
   - Quote status: Draft → Sent → Accepted/Declined
   - Generate PDF
   - Send quote via email (or at least call the SendGrid function)
   - Public quote view/acceptance link (if implemented): acceptance should timestamp who accepted and when

5) Invoices
   - Convert quote → invoice (if implemented)
   - Or create invoice directly
   - Invoice numbers (INV-1001 etc.)
   - Correct totals & GST
   - PDF generation
   - Status: Draft → Sent → Paid → Overdue
   - “Mark as paid” + payment date stored
   - If Stripe payment link is implemented, ensure the invoice state updates on successful payment

6) Calendar / schedule
   - Jobs appear on the correct date/time
   - Clicking job in calendar opens job detail
   - No broken queries or empty screens

7) Chat
   - Job chat: messages attached to a specific job
   - Team/general chat: messages attached to business/team
   - Messages saved with who + when
   - Good error handling (no silent failures)

8) Files / photos
   - Upload file/photo to a job
   - File metadata saved in DB and visible in job detail
   - No hard-coded URLs or mock data

For ANY of these that are only partially implemented or are “UI only”, either:
- Finish them to a usable beta state, OR
- Clearly mark them in code and hide them in the UI so tradies won’t see unfinished features.

────────────────────────────────
2. CHECK BACKEND & CLOUD / OFFLINE BEHAVIOUR
────────────────────────────────
I want this to be backed by a real database and feel reliable.

- Confirm all main entities are persisted in a real DB:
  - users
  - business
  - clients
  - jobs
  - quotes
  - invoices
  - messages (chat)
  - files (or file metadata)
  - subscriptions/payments

- Ensure there is **no fake/mock data** in production/beta paths.
- Implement sensible loading and error states (no blank screens).

Offline:
- If any offline/“retry later” behaviour exists, verify it works (queued writes, simple caching).
- If offline mode is NOT implemented, make sure the app **fails gracefully**:
  - Clear error messages when the network fails.
  - No infinite spinners.

────────────────────────────────
3. STRIPE & SENDGRID PRODUCTION-STYLE SETUP
────────────────────────────────
For **Stripe**:
- Use environment variables for all keys (no secrets in client).
- Confirm:
  - Subscription logic for my platform billing works in TEST mode.
  - If Stripe Connect is implemented:
    - tradie’s Stripe account ID is stored correctly
    - charges go to the right place (with platform fee if used)
  - Webhook handlers update subscription and invoice/payment status correctly.
- Check error handling:
  - Failed payment
  - Cancelled payment
  - Expired checkout links

For **SendGrid**:
- Ensure the API key is only used server-side.
- Confirm email helpers exist for:
  - welcome/onboarding (optional)
  - quote sent
  - invoice sent
  - payment receipt
- Use a verified “from” domain pattern like:
  - `TradieTrack for {BusinessName} <no-reply@mydomain>`
  - Reply-To = tradie’s business email (so customers reply to tradie, not me).
- Make sure emails don’t break if some fields (logo, ABN) are missing; handle gracefully.

────────────────────────────────
4. SECURITY, AUTH, AND RLS
────────────────────────────────
- Verify AUTH:
  - Protect all private routes (dashboard, jobs, quotes, invoices, chat, settings).
  - Redirect unauthenticated users to login.
- Verify **role-based access**:
  - Owner/admin vs staff:
    - Only owners can manage billing and business settings.
    - Staff cannot see or edit other businesses.
- Verify **Row Level Security** (if using Supabase or similar):
  - Users can only access records for their own business.
- Remove any debug endpoints or test routes from beta environment.

────────────────────────────────
5. UI/UX POLISH FOR A “TECHNICALLY SOLID BETA”
────────────────────────────────
Think like a busy tradie using this on their phone.

Check:

- **Dashboard/Activity**
  - Clear “Today” / “Next job” panel.
  - Simple cards: jobs today, pending quotes, unpaid invoices.
  - No big unused columns or awkward left-heavy layouts.

- **Navigation**
  - Bottom nav on mobile is consistent and clear.
  - Icons + labels are understandable (Home/Activity, Jobs, Quotes/Invoices, More).
  - No dead menu items that point to WIP pages.

- **Consistency**
  - Same spacing system across pages.
  - Same card style (radius/shadow) across dashboard, job detail, lists.
  - Buttons use consistent labels like:
    - “New job”
    - “Send quote”
    - “Convert to invoice”
    - “Mark as paid”

- **Empty states**
  - For empty jobs/clients/quotes/invoices, show friendly explainer text + CTA (e.g. “You don’t have any jobs yet. Create your first job.”).
  - Avoid completely blank pages.

- **Error & success messages**
  - Show friendly toasts/messages on:
    - save success
    - send success
    - failure to save/send
  - No cryptic error messages from raw API.

────────────────────────────────
6. CLEANUP: REMOVE PROTOTYPE STUFF, PREPARE BETA
────────────────────────────────
- Remove or hide:
  - any prototype buttons or test widgets
  - dummy/test data in UI
  - commented-out UI elements that confuse layout
- Ensure:
  - All main menu items lead to working features.
  - Any “coming soon” features are clearly labeled as such and not clickable, or hidden for now.

────────────────────────────────
7. FINAL SUMMARY
────────────────────────────────
After you’ve made improvements:

- Provide a short summary in comments or a markdown file:
  1) Which core flows are now fully working and tested.
  2) Which features are intentionally marked as “coming soon”.
  3) Any important known issues that are acceptable for a closed beta.
  4) Anything I MUST test manually before inviting 3–5 real tradies.

Treat this as a **master QA + production-readiness pass** to make TradieTrack feel technically solid and ready for **real-world beta testing**, not just a demo UI.
```

Email:

```text
Hey [Name],

I’m working on a new app called **TradieTrack** – it’s a simple job, quote & invoice system built specifically for tradies like you.

Instead of jumping between notes, texts and random PDF templates, the idea is:

- all your **jobs, clients, quotes and invoices** in one place  
- a clear **“Today / This week”** view  
- clean, branded **PDF quotes & invoices** with your logo & ABN  
- online card payments (beta)  
- job notes, photos and chat all attached to each job  

Right now I’m looking for **3–5 tradies** to use it in **beta** and give honest feedback.

What you’d get:

- ✅ Free access during the beta period  
- ✅ Lifetime discount when paid plans launch  
- ✅ Direct input into how the app works for tradies  
- ✅ My help setting it up (I’ll walk you through your first job, quote & invoice)

What I’d ask from you:

- Use it on some real jobs for 2–4 weeks  
- Send a few real quotes/invoices through it  
- Be honest about what works, what sucks and what’s missing  

If that sounds interesting, reply with:

> “I’m keen for the beta”

and I’ll set you up with an account and quick walkthrough.
