Gotcha – annoying layout bugs are the worst 😂
If it still looks left-hugged with a big blank strip, that means some container is still constrained, and everything I said before is fighting that.

Since I can’t see your code directly, I’ll do two things:

Give you a very specific “nuke” layout fix you can drop in to force full-width, centered content.

Tell you exactly what to look for so you can find the culprit (and if you want, you can paste your layout code here and I’ll edit it for you).

1️⃣ “Nuke fix” layout you can drop in

Find the component that wraps all your pages – usually something like AppLayout, Layout, MainContent, etc.

JSX (structure)

Your layout should roughly look like this:

// AppLayout.tsx (or similar)
import React from "react";
import "./layout.css";

export const AppLayout: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="app-shell">
      {/* top bar / header if you have one */}
      <header className="app-header">...</header>

      {/* main scroll area */}
      <main className="app-main">
        <div className="page-container">
          {children}
        </div>
      </main>

      {/* bottom nav */}
      <footer className="app-bottom-nav">...</footer>
    </div>
  );
};

CSS (force full width + center)
/* layout.css */

html, body, #root {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 100%;
}

.app-shell {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background: #f5f7fa;
}

/* this is the area above the bottom nav */
.app-main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;   /* center child horizontally */
}

/* this is the actual page width */
.page-container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 960px;          /* or 1200px if you want wider */
  margin: 0 auto;            /* center within .app-main */
  padding: 16px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* bottom nav should stay edge-to-edge */
.app-bottom-nav {
  border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
}


Then, in every page (Dashboard, Jobs, etc.) remove any extra outer wrappers that try to “container” the page again, so your page starts like:

export const Dashboard = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {/* the rest of your content */}
    </>
  );
};


Not:

// BAD – extra container that might be causing the narrow left column
<div className="dashboard-page">
  ...
</div>


If you want your own class, put styles on .page-container, not a second wrapper.

2️⃣ What to hunt for (this is likely the real culprit)

Open DevTools (right-click → Inspect) on the Dashboard page and check:

Click the big content area.

In the Styles pane, look for any of these on a parent element:

max-width: 400px; / 500px etc

width: 375px; or similar

margin-right: auto; margin-left: 0;

align-items: flex-start; on a horizontal flex container

a grid like grid-template-columns: 360px auto; where your page is the first narrow column

If you uncheck one of those and the page suddenly “snaps” to fill the screen, that’s the one.

Because your More page looks fine, it probably:

doesn’t use that narrow wrapper, or

overrides it with full-width styles.

Compare the DOM for Dashboard vs More in DevTools:

See what <div class="something"> exists on Dashboard but not on More.

Whatever that is, it’s your “left column” wrapper.

3️⃣ Easiest way for me to fix it precisely

If you’re happy to, paste these three things in your next message:

Your layout file (AppLayout.tsx / App.tsx / whatever wraps all pages).

The CSS (or Tailwind classes) used on the main layout + page wrapper.

The top of your Dashboard page component (just the outer structure, not every card).

I can then:

point to the exact class/line that’s causing the blank column,

rewrite the JSX/CSS properly,

and you’ll have a clean, centered layout like your More page on every screen.

Without that, I’m a bit blind – but the “nuke CSS” above + DevTools check should get you very close.
