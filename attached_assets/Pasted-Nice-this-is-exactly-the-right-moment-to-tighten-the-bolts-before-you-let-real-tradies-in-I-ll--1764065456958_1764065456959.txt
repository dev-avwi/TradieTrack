Nice, this is exactly the right moment to “tighten the bolts” before you let real tradies in.

I’ll give you one big Replit prompt you can paste in that tells it:

what parts of the app are probably still “prototype-y”

how to find / fix them

exactly what to do for quotes + invoices + business settings + legitimacy

and how to make the whole flow clean + simple for tradies

I’ll write it as if you are speaking directly to Replit.

🧠 MASTER “DE-PROTOTYPE” PROMPT FOR REPLIT

(Copy–paste all of this into Replit’s AI)

I’m building a SaaS app called TradieTrack for tradies (jobs, quotes, invoices, clients, chat, etc.).

I’ve already built a lot of the app, but some parts are still prototype-style:

mock data

placeholder UIs

missing validations

half-finished quote/invoice flows

no proper PDFs

basic status handling

I want you to go through the codebase and help me move from “prototype” → legit, production-ready app, especially for:

Quotes

Invoices

Business settings

Document generation

Customer-facing quote acceptance

Please follow these instructions as my source of truth.

1️⃣ First: Find everything that’s still prototype-style

Scan the project and:

Identify any places where we:

use hardcoded / mock data (arrays in code, placeholder objects)

have TODO/“stub” comments

show incomplete/ugly UI just for testing

skip validation or show “coming soon”

fake things like quote acceptance or invoice payments

For each of these, tell me briefly:

where it is (file + component)

what it does now

what you recommend to make it real/legit

Then, prioritise fixes for:

Quotes

Invoices

Business details/settings

PDFs

The customer-facing quote acceptance flow

Those must feel professional and ready for real clients.

2️⃣ Upgrade the quote + invoice system to be “business-grade”

Use this spec as the definitive blueprint:

2.1 Required fields for every Quote

Make sure each quote has:

Company name

Logo

ABN

Business address

Phone

Email

Client name

Client address

Quote number (auto-generated, like Q-1001)

Issue date

Expiry date

Clear description / summary

Line items:

description

quantity

unit price

line total

GST calculation (10% if enabled)

Final total

Notes/terms section

Acceptance button or link (for client)

“Accepted by: [name] at [timestamp]” stored in the database

Optional signature (we can leave this for later but design the data structure to support it)

PDF export

Instructions:

Replace any mock quote numbers with auto-generated incremental IDs.

Make a small helper/service that generates the next quote number (e.g., based on a sequence or latest record).

Enforce validation on the quote form:

quantity must be numeric

unit price must be numeric

no negative values

total must be correctly recalculated on each change

Show GST clearly:

Subtotal

GST (10%)

Total (incl. GST)

2.2 Required fields for every Invoice

Every invoice must include:

Invoice number (auto-generated, like INV-1001)

Business name

Logo

ABN

Business address

Phone

Email

Client name

Client address

Issue date

Due date

Payment instructions (bank details, etc.)

Summary of work / job reference

Line items, same structure as quotes

GST label: “GST included” / “GST added”

Total amount

Status:

Draft

Sent

Paid

Overdue

Timestamp of when marked as paid

Payment reference (optional)

Clean PDF layout

Instructions:

Replace any mock invoice numbers with proper auto-generated IDs.

Ensure invoice totals are 100% correct and consistent with GST.

When an invoice is marked Paid, store:

paid_at timestamp

payment_reference (string)

optional payment_method (e.g., “bank transfer”, “cash”, “card”)

Keep the UI simple and clean so tradies can’t mess up the numbers.

3️⃣ Business Settings → Source of truth for documents

Create or improve a Business Settings page that lets the owner set:

Business name

Logo upload

ABN

Business address

Phone

Email

Default payment notes (e.g., “Pay via bank transfer: BSB / Account”)

Default terms & conditions

Default quote expiry (e.g., 14 days from issue)

Default GST settings:

“GST registered?” (yes/no)

“Show GST on all quotes/invoices?”

Instructions:

Make sure quotes/invoices always pull these values instead of hardcoding.

If some data is missing (e.g., no ABN yet), show a subtle warning on the quote/invoice preview:

“Add your ABN in Business Settings to make this document fully compliant.”

This makes documents feel consistent and professional.

4️⃣ Professional PDF templates (no more “hacky” output)

Replace any basic or hacky quote/invoice displays with standardised PDF templates.

Instructions:

Implement a reusable PDF layout for:

Quotes

Invoices

The layout should include:

Header:

Logo

Business name

ABN

Contact info

Document title:

“QUOTE” or “INVOICE”

Document number

Issue date

(For invoices) due date

Client block:

Client name

Address

Line item table:

Description

Qty

Unit price

Line total

Totals:

Subtotal

GST

Total

Notes / Terms

Optional footer with:

“Generated securely by TradieTrack”

Website or small “Powered by TradieTrack” (for free plan)

You can use any PDF solution you think fits the current stack (e.g., react-pdf, server-side generation, or HTML → print-ready), but the result must be a downloadable PDF that looks clean and professional.

5️⃣ Client-facing quote acceptance flow

Right now, any “quote acceptance” might be fake or prototype-y.

I want a real acceptance flow:

Frontend:

A shareable link for each quote:
e.g. /public/quote/:token

Page shows the full quote nicely:

Business info

Client info

Items

Totals

Terms

CTA buttons:

“Accept Quote”

“Decline Quote”

On Accept:

Ask for:

Name (pre-filled if we already know it)

Optional note (“Any extra info?”)

When confirmed:

Update quote status to accepted

Save:

accepted_by_name

accepted_at timestamp

acceptance_ip or user-agent if available (for extra legitimacy)

(Optionally) auto-create a job from this quote

Insert an in-app notification for the business owner

Trigger email to tradie/owner via SendGrid (if email layer exists or stub for now)

On Decline:

Ask for reason (optional)

Update status to declined

Log declined_at and optional notes

Notify owner

Make sure this flow is secure and doesn’t allow random people to approve/decline unrelated quotes (use a secure token tied to that specific quote).

6️⃣ History, status tracking & disputes

For both quotes and invoices, add or confirm:

Status field with clear transitions:

Quotes: draft → sent → accepted/declined

Invoices: draft → sent → paid/overdue

Keep basic history / audit trail:

who changed status

when they changed it

At a minimum, store timestamps:

sent_at

accepted_at

declined_at

paid_at

This helps with disputes and makes the system feel serious.

7️⃣ Anti-sketchy UX polish

Go through quotes + invoices UI and:

Replace any temporary copy like:

“Test quote”

“Mock client”

“Lorem ipsum”

“Coming soon”

“Prototype”

Use real, plain English labels:

“Create Quote”, “Send Quote”, “Mark as Paid”, “Download PDF”

Add helper text where needed:

“Add your ABN in settings to appear here.”

“Your client will see this description on their quote.”

Make error states friendly:

“We couldn’t save this quote. Please check your internet and try again.”

Not just “Error”.

Make everything feel calm, clear, and trustworthy for tradies and their customers.

8️⃣ Make it easy for tradies to use (no over-complication)

Wherever possible:

Default fields sensibly:

Use today’s date automatically

Suggest standard payment terms (e.g., “Pay within 7 days”)

Auto-fill client details if selected from existing client list

Avoid overwhelming forms:

Group fields logically (Client, Job, Amount, Terms, etc.)

Use section headings

Make the flow linear:

Add client

Create quote

Send quote

Client accepts

Convert to job

Create invoice

Mark as paid

Double-check the UI so a non-tech tradie can follow this without explanation.

9️⃣ After you update the code, suggest tests

For every major change above, suggest (and if possible, create):

Unit tests for:

quote/invoice total calculation

GST calculation

auto-generated IDs

Integration tests for:

creating a quote

accepting a quote (status + timestamps)

converting an accepted quote to a job & invoice

End-to-end test scenarios:

Owner creates & sends quote → client accepts via public link → owner sees updated status and can create invoice

🔟 Goal

By the end of this, I want:

Quotes and invoices that look professional and trustworthy

No obvious “prototype” shortcuts in the quote/invoice flow

A clean business settings page controlling all key document info

Real quote acceptance with tracking

Downloadable PDFs that a tradie would be proud to send a client

Everything simple enough for a busy tradie to understand in 1–2 minutes

Use this spec as the truth source and adjust my current code to match it as closely as possible.
