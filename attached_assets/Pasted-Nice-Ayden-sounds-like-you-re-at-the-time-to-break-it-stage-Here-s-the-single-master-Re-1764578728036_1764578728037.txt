## 🧪 TradieTrack – Replit Master Testing Prompt

> You are my senior QA + product engineer helping me test and polish my web app **TradieTrack** – a job, quote and invoice management app for tradies in Australia (plumbers, sparkies, etc.).
>
> The app already *looks* quite polished. Now I want you to focus on:
>
> * **A) Core flows & reliability**
> * **B) UX & UI consistency**
> * **C) Integrations & data (Stripe, SendGrid, auth, storage)**
> * **D) Offline behaviour & cloud sync**
>
> Your job is to:
>
> 1. Read the codebase.
> 2. Run the app.
> 3. Use it like a real tradie business.
> 4. Report issues + suggest具体 fixes (code + UX).

### A) Core flows & reliability – FULL CHECKLIST

Please test these end-to-end flows and tell me what works, what’s broken, and what feels half-finished:

1. **Sign up & login**

   * Email + password auth.
   * “Continue with Google” (if present).
   * Validation for bad email, weak password, duplicate accounts.
   * Reset password flow (if implemented).

2. **Onboarding**

   * Creating a new business:

     * Business name, trade type, ABN, contact details.
     * Choosing trade (plumbing, electrical, etc.).
     * Team setup: owner + additional staff users (different roles).
   * Make sure:

     * Required fields are enforced with clear errors.
     * Onboarding can be skipped/resumed.
     * Data actually saves to the backend and is used across the app.

3. **Roles & permissions**

   * At minimum: **Owner/Admin vs Staff/Field Worker**.
   * Confirm:

     * Owner can see everything.
     * Staff can’t access billing, subscription, or global settings.
     * Permissions are enforced server-side (not just hidden in the UI).

4. **Jobs → Quotes → Invoices**
   Do a full lifecycle test as if you’re a tradie:

   * Create a **Client**.
   * Create a **Job** for that client.
   * Add job details (address, description, due date, status).
   * Create a **Quote** from that job:

     * Line items (qty, unit price, GST).
     * Auto-calculated totals.
     * Quote number (Q-1001 style), issue date, expiry date.
   * “Send” the quote (even if it just simulates email).
   * Convert the accepted quote into a **Job** and then into an **Invoice**.
   * Invoice should have:

     * Invoice number (INV-1001 style).
     * Status: Draft / Sent / Paid / Overdue.
     * Payment terms + due date.
   * Mark invoice as **Paid** and confirm:

     * Status + paid date update.
     * Any job / client balances update correctly.

5. **Calendar & schedule**

   * Add jobs to specific days and times.
   * Ensure:

     * Time zone behaviour is sensible.
     * Jobs show correctly in any list & calendar views.
     * Mobile layout still works.

6. **Attachments & files**

   * Try uploading a few files (images/PDFs) against a job, quote, or invoice.
   * Check:

     * Upload success + error states.
     * File size/type limits and messages.
     * That files are re-loadable after refresh.

7. **Messaging / Chat (if present)**

   * Test:

     * Team chat.
     * Job-specific chat.
   * Confirm:

     * Messages are stored with correct job & user.
     * Different users see the same history.
     * Read/unread or at least sensible ordering.

8. **Demo / mock data mode (if implemented)**

   * Turn on Demo/Beta mode.
   * Verify:

     * A demo account is pre-loaded with mock jobs, clients, quotes & invoices.
     * It’s clearly labelled as demo.
     * No real Stripe/SendGrid actions fire in demo mode.

### B) UX & UI consistency – FULL REVIEW

Please review the app like a product designer and comment on:

1. **Navigation**

   * Bottom nav on mobile vs sidebar/left nav on desktop:

     * Is it consistent across all pages?
     * Are icons and labels clear (Home, Jobs, Clients, Invoices, More, etc.)?
   * No “dead ends” or screens without a way back.

2. **Dashboard**

   * Does the home screen instantly answer:

     * How many jobs today?
     * Any overdue invoices?
     * Revenue this month?
   * Are cards aligned, spacing consistent, and content centered?
   * No weird unused columns or blank white space on the right.

3. **Forms**

   * Are forms short, clear, and grouped logically?
   * Consistent input styles, labels, error messages.
   * Useful defaults (e.g., today’s date, 14-day expiry, etc.).

4. **Tables & lists**

   * Jobs, Clients, Quotes, Invoices lists:

     * Sort & filter behaviour.
     * Pagination or infinite scroll.
     * Loading & empty states (not just blank).

5. **Visual consistency**

   * Use the new **blue/orange TradieTrack branding**:

     * Same primary blue & orange as in the logo.
     * Buttons, highlights, tags use this palette.
   * Check typography:

     * Prefer modern sans (e.g., Inter/Manrope/SF Pro style).
     * Consistent sizes for headings, body, labels.

6. **Dark mode**

   * If dark mode exists:

     * Check all screens: text contrast, icon visibility, borders.
     * No white flashes or unreadable grey-on-grey text.

Please output:

* A list of **UX polish suggestions** grouped by page (Dashboard, Jobs, Clients, Quotes, Invoices, Settings, etc.).
* Mark each suggestion as **High / Medium / Low** impact.

### C) Integrations & data – Stripe, SendGrid, auth, storage

1. **Authentication**

   * Confirm tokens/sessions are handled securely.
   * Sensitive routes protected server-side (API guards / middleware).

2. **Stripe**

   * Two cases:

     1. **App subscription billing** (TradieTrack Pro vs Basic).
     2. **(If implemented)** Client payments for invoices.
   * Verify:

     * Correct Stripe keys are loaded from environment variables.
     * Webhook endpoints exist and handle:

       * `checkout.session.completed`
       * subscription updates/cancellations.
     * The app updates:

       * user’s subscription tier
       * trial status
       * limits (e.g., branding removal, advanced features).

3. **SendGrid (Twilio SendGrid)**

   * There are **two use cases**:

     1. Emails from **my system to tradies** (welcome, trial ending, etc.).
     2. Emails **tradies send to their clients** (quotes, invoices, payment receipts).
   * Ensure:

     * API key is not hard-coded.
     * Emails are built from templates.
     * Business branding (name, logo, contact details) appears on client-facing emails.
     * Proper error handling/logging if SendGrid fails.
   * For tests, it’s fine to:

     * Use a sandbox/test mode.
     * Log email payloads instead of actually sending.

4. **Data model & storage**

   * Confirm the main entities and relationships:

     * Users, Businesses, TeamMembers/Roles
     * Clients
     * Jobs
     * Quotes
     * Invoices
     * Attachments / Files
     * Messages (if chat)
   * Check referential integrity:

     * Deleting a client doesn’t silently orphan jobs.
     * Jobs always have a valid client and business.
     * Quotes and invoices always belong to a job/client.

5. **Security & privacy basics**

   * No secrets in the frontend bundle.
   * Basic validation on API routes.
   * Only the right users can access a business’s data.

Please list:

* Any **integration misconfigurations**.
* Any obviously missing **error handling** or **security checks**.
* Suggested **code-level improvements** (e.g., where to centralise billing, notification, or document generation logic).

### D) Offline behaviour & cloud sync

I want TradieTrack to feel reliable on the road.

Please:

1. Check if there is any Service Worker / PWA support:

   * If yes:

     * Does it cache core assets for offline use?
     * Does it handle network loss gracefully?
   * If not:

     * Suggest a simple PWA/offline strategy.

2. Test behaviour when:

   * Creating/editing a job **while offline**.
   * Creating a quote or invoice offline.
   * Coming back online.
   * Does data sync properly to the backend?
   * If offline is **not** implemented, explain the simplest architecture to:

     * Cache local edits (localStorage/IndexedDB).
     * Queue sync to API when connection returns.

3. Make concrete recommendations:

   * “Here’s how I would implement basic offline-first behaviour for jobs, quotes, and invoices in this codebase.”

### Final output format

Please give me:

1. **Summary**

   * One short paragraph: “Is TradieTrack ready for closed beta with 3–5 real tradies?”

2. **Critical issues (must fix before beta)**

   * Numbered list with file names / components and specific fixes.

3. **Important UX improvements (next 1–2 weeks)**

   * Grouped by page.

4. **Nice-to-have polish & future ideas**

   * Things to consider after launch.

5. **Checklist for me to tick off**

   * A compact bullet list I can paste into my own task manager.

Use clear headings, be blunt and honest, and assume I’m 14 but serious about turning this into a real SaaS.
