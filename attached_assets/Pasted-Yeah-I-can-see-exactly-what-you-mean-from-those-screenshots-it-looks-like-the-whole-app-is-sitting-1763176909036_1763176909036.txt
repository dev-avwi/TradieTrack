Yeah I can see exactly what you mean from those screenshots – it looks like the whole app is sitting in a narrow column stuck to the left, and there’s a big empty strip on the right on every page except More.

That’s almost always caused by one wrapper having a fixed/max width and the wrong margins, or a flex/grid layout that isn’t centering.

Let me walk you through:

1️⃣ What’s probably happening

From the screenshots:

Bottom nav goes all the way across → so the outer app is full-width.

But the content area (Dashboard, Jobs, etc.) is inside a wrapper that’s:

max-width: something (like 400–500px), and

using margin-right: auto; margin-left: 0; or no margin at all → so it hugs the left.

The More page clearly uses a different wrapper or no max-width, so it fills the screen properly.

When you “removed the scroll wheel”, you or Replit likely:

changed something like overflow-x or

changed a grid/flex layout that previously allowed sideways scroll.

But the root is: one container is too narrow and not centered.

2️⃣ How to fix the layout (concept)

You want something like:

.app-main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;  /* center the page horizontally */
}

.page {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 960px;      /* or whatever breakpoint you like */
  margin: 0 auto;        /* center inside */
  padding: 1.5rem;       /* spacing */
}


or, if you don’t care about max-width yet:

.page {
  width: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}


Key things to avoid:

margin-left: 0; margin-right: auto; on the main page container

align-items: flex-start on a horizontal flex layout that’s treating the page as a flex child and pushing it left

A max-width set without margin: 0 auto;

3️⃣ What to tell Replit to do

You can literally paste this as a prompt into Replit’s AI:

In my React app, the main content is stuck on the left with a big empty blank column on the right on most pages (Dashboard, Jobs, etc.).
The bottom navigation is full width, but the page content is inside a narrow column on the left.
The “More” page looks correct and fills the width.

Please:

Find the main layout / page wrapper components (e.g. AppLayout, MainContent, .page etc.).

Make sure the main content area is centered and responsive:

The main content should use width: 100% and optionally max-width: 960px.

It should use margin: 0 auto; so it’s centered, not left-aligned.

Ensure that any flex or grid parent doesn’t force the content to stay at the left – use justify-content: center if needed.

Make the Dashboard, Jobs, Quotes, Invoices, and other pages use the same .page container styles as the “More” page, so they all align the same.

Remove any hard-coded max-width or margin-right: auto that is only applied on these pages.

Show me the updated layout CSS/JSX so the app content is centered and fills the available space like the “More” page does.

4️⃣ If you want to try manually

If you can find whatever component wraps all pages (often called Page, Content, Main, etc.), give it something like:

/* main shell */
.app-shell {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

/* area above bottom nav */
.app-content {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* each page */
.page {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 960px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 16px;
}


And remove any weird styles like float, margin-left: 24px, or max-width: 420px on the Dashboard/Jobs pages.
