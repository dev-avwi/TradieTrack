firstly make sure the business templates from the web app is syncd with mobile app cause right now it isnt:
now recall the workflow for a tradie including all phases and steps and options they have, and when i say fulll workflow i mean full workflow in what they can take and types of workflows if a job was cancelled adn succeeded and wahetevr so i know you got everything right and ready to go, and when i say full workflow i want a really indepth guide from receiving text to sending receipt and mayeb even follow up email. i want you to go back to basics and ensure that the workflow is polished and that recall it to me so i know you know what to do
great job with the web where since you know thatweb cant collect payments, you automatically switch to qr code which is true, but let the tradie know this, cause what if their trying and finally realise its not possible. also there needs to be more detail when manually collecting payment theres just not enough detail like client, and everything so it saves and yeah make sure collecting payment links to items like invoice and links to client or job or whatever. cause allow the payment flow to work relaly well within the job journey so that when click collect payment in job journey it automatically puts all details into the payment request and also within it you should ask tradie for generating receipt automatically, or manually so right after payment is truely collected there can be receipt automatically generated in popup and you can click on it to preview, or after collecting the receipt can be manualyl edited like quote and invoice where theres live preview editing, this should work for manual collecting too. and also another great feature is for aftrer manual collecting payment you can later link it to a job/invoice so yeah thinking about it in a flow and when linking it should all talkj to each other so that it pops up within an invoice, liek the link documents, then within job where its in documents section and all the rest you know. so make it easy and clear for tradies to collect from withjin the job and manually, and yeah that after collecting payment allow for easy generating receipt in however way tradie wants to do it, and also sending the receipt through manual opening gmail with composed business template email, or by auitomatically connecting to sendgrid or however our system works. and make sure the payment flow works easily, clear and is properly integrated and not just UI with the whole workflow you know and more.
