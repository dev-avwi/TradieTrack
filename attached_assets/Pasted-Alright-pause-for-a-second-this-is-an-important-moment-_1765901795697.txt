Alright, pause for a second — this is an important moment and you’re actually asking the right question now.

I’ll answer this properly, honestly, and in a way you could literally explain to your dad or a tradie.

1️⃣ Do tradies ACTUALLY use Tradify / ServiceM8 daily?

Yes — they absolutely do.
Not because those apps are “beautiful”, but because they solve boring, painful daily problems.

Tradies use them for:

Creating quotes on the job

Sending invoices immediately

Tracking jobs & schedules

Getting paid faster

Keeping accountants happy

Avoiding paperwork at night

Many tradies don’t love these apps.
They tolerate them because:

Switching is risky

Data loss scares them

Integrations matter more than UI

Their accountant told them to use it

So here’s the key insight 👇

Tradies don’t stay because the app is amazing — they stay because switching feels scary.

That’s GOOD news for you.

2️⃣ “My app looks way better” — will tradies switch just for that?

Short answer: Not for UI alone.
Long answer: YES if you remove the switching pain.

Tradies will switch if ALL of these are true:

✅ It does everything they already rely on
✅ It talks to their accounting software
✅ Their data can move over
✅ It saves time, not adds steps
✅ It works on phone AND web
✅ It feels modern and fast
✅ They trust it won’t break

You’re already solving:

UI/UX (you’re ahead here)

Mobile + Web parity

Team workflows

Maps + dispatch

Quotes → invoices → payments

Offline-first thinking

Now you’re entering “grown-up SaaS territory”: integrations.

3️⃣ Why Tradify / ServiceM8 make so much money

They’re not selling an app.

They’re selling:

Accounting compliance

Time saved

Peace of mind

Tradify’s power comes from:

Xero

MYOB

QuickBooks

Stripe

Bank feeds

BAS / GST accuracy

Once a tradie’s accountant is happy, the tradie NEVER leaves easily.

That’s the moat.

4️⃣ Can TradieTrack realistically compete if you integrate Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks?

Yes — but in phases.
You don’t need everything on day one.

Phase 1 (what you’re doing now – correct)

Jobs

Quotes

Invoices

Payments

Teams

Maps

Time tracking

PDFs

Email

Mobile-first UX

This is enough for:

Solo tradies

Small teams (1–5)

Cairns local market

Phase 2 (this is where switching starts)

Read-only accounting sync

Push invoices to Xero

Push payments to Xero

Sync contacts

Sync GST codes

At this point:

TradieTrack becomes “safe” to try.

Phase 3 (danger zone for competitors)

Two-way sync

Update invoice status

Pull customer data

Pull chart of accounts

Auto-reconcile payments

This is where Tradify users start to consider switching.

5️⃣ How Xero / MYOB / QuickBooks integration ACTUALLY works (simple)

This is important so you don’t overthink it.

You do NOT:

❌ Rebuild accounting
❌ Handle BAS
❌ Touch tax logic

You DO:

✅ Use their APIs
✅ Push clean data
✅ Let accountants do their thing

Typical flow:

Tradie connects Xero via OAuth

TradieTrack gets permission

When invoice is created:

Send invoice → Xero

When payment happens:

Send payment → Xero

Accountant sees everything there

That’s it.

Your app stays job-focused, not accounting-focused.

6️⃣ Will tradies switch if TradieTrack is “way better”?

Here’s the honest truth:

They will NOT switch if:

Data migration is painful

Accounting isn’t supported

It feels risky

They WILL switch if:

You say: “We’ll migrate you”

It works with Xero

It’s cheaper OR clearly better

It feels faster on-site

Their workers love the app

Maps + dispatch saves time

Mobile experience is better than Tradify

Your advantage is:

You’re mobile-first

You care about UX

You’re building modern workflows

You’re local (Cairns)

Big companies lose on speed and care.

7️⃣ The smart positioning for TradieTrack (this matters)

Don’t position as:

“Better Tradify”

Position as:

“The modern tradie app built for mobile teams — with accounting sync when you need it.”

Key message:

Use TradieTrack all day

Accounting just happens in the background

8️⃣ Reality check (this is important)

You are:

Building at founder-level

Thinking like a SaaS company

Solving real problems

Doing this at 14 (which is insane, in a good way)

But don’t fall into this trap:

“My app is better so people will switch”

The real win is:

“My app is safer, smoother, and more enjoyable to use every single day.”

That’s how ServiceM8 won originally.

9️⃣ What I’d do NEXT if I were you (very concrete)
Immediate (next 2–4 weeks)

Finalise core workflows

Kill any “UI-only” features

Make mobile flawless

Lock onboarding flows

Beta test with 2–3 real tradies

Short-term (next 2–3 months)

Xero read-only integration

Invoice + payment push

Migration tools (CSV import)

Accountant-friendly exports

Long-term

Full accounting sync

App store launch

Scale outside Cairns

10️⃣ Answer to your core question (no sugar-coating)

“Do tradies actually use Tradify daily?”

Yes.

“Can TradieTrack compete?”

Yes — if you respect why they stay.

“Is my app wasted time?”

No. You’re building something very real.

“Will tradies switch?”

Some won’t.
Some will.
Enough will — if you do integrations properly.
