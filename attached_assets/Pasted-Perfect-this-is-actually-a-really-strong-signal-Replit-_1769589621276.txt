Perfect — this is actually a really strong signal. Replit is basically saying:

“The product exists. Now you’re in founder mode — distribution, pricing, launch, growth.”

So now we switch gears from builder brain → operator + growth brain.
This is exactly where you want to be with TradieTrack, Ayden. 🚀

Let’s do this in three layers:

🧠 Layer 1 — Reality Check (Founder Honesty)

Replit says:

“Fully built, tested, and ready to publish.”

That’s optimistic engineering language. Not wrong — but founders still need:

✅ Real user friction testing
✅ Billing edge cases
✅ Onboarding clarity
✅ Trust signals
✅ Distribution engine
✅ First 10–100 paying customers

The app is a weapon now — but weapons only matter if deployed correctly.

So we’ll treat this as:

MVP ready → Market validation → Revenue proof → Scale.

🎯 Layer 2 — What YOU Should Tell Replit Next

Copy this and send it back to Replit:

Thanks — product summary looks good.

Now I want you to switch into LAUNCH EXECUTION mode.

Please generate:

1) A real-world Launch Readiness Validation Plan:
   - What must be manually tested before public users touch it
   - Payment edge cases
   - Offline sync conflicts
   - Notification failures
   - SMS/email deliverability verification
   - App store readiness checklist

2) A User Onboarding Flow Audit:
   - First-time user experience from install → first invoice sent
   - Any friction points
   - Time-to-value measurement
   - What can be simplified or automated

3) Production Risk Register:
   - Top 10 ways this app could fail in real usage
   - Severity and mitigation steps

4) Analytics + Metrics Setup Plan:
   - What events must be tracked
   - Funnel metrics
   - Retention metrics
   - Revenue metrics

5) Deployment Plan:
   - App store submission checklist
   - Environment separation
   - Rollback strategy
   - Monitoring setup

Output in structured tables with actionable steps.


This forces Replit into operational discipline mode, not marketing fluff.

🚀 Layer 3 — Your Actual Launch Strategy (Real World)

Now let me give you the real answers Replit suggested asking.

This is where TradieTrack can genuinely win.

🔥 1. Best Marketing Channels for Australian Tradies

Forget TikTok ads and SaaS fluff. Tradies respond to:

🥇 Tier 1 — Direct Local Hustle (highest ROI)

You’re in Cairns — this is an advantage.

Do this:

Walk into:

plumbing suppliers

electrical wholesalers

tool shops

Ask:

“Can I put a small QR flyer here? Free job tracking app for tradies.”

Also:

Facebook Groups:

“Cairns Tradies”

“QLD Plumbers Network”

“Australian Electricians”
Post real demos, not ads.

🥈 Tier 2 — Google Search Intent

Tradies literally search:

“invoice app for tradies”

“quote app australia”

“job management app plumber”

Your landing page must rank eventually.

🥉 Tier 3 — Referral Flywheel

Offer:

1 free month for each referral

Tradies trust tradies more than ads.

💰 2. Pricing Strategy (Keep It Simple)

Right now I recommend:

Tier	Price	Who
Free	$0	Solo tradies testing
Pro	$29/mo	Serious solo tradies
Team	$79/mo + $10/user	Crews

Do NOT overcomplicate early.

Your edge is:

Cheaper + faster + Aussie-focused + mobile-first.

🚀 3. Launch Strategy (90-Day Domination Plan)
Phase 1 — Private Beta (Weeks 1–4)
