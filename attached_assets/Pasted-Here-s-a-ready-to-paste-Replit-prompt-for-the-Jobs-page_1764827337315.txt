## ✅ Replit Prompt — TradieTrack **Jobs Screen**

**PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT:**

---

I am rebuilding the TradieTrack **Jobs** page from my web app into a **React Native (Expo) mobile app**.
I want you to recreate the UI **as close as possible to the web layout and styling**, but optimised for mobile.

I have two reference screenshots (desktop + mobile) that show the full design of the Jobs screen:

* Desktop: sidebar, top bar, “Jobs”, filters, stats cards, recent activity, all jobs list.
* Mobile: top app bar, “Jobs”, New Job button, filters row, stats grid, recent activity card, all jobs, bottom nav.

### 🎯 Tech Stack to Use

Build this screen with:

* Expo + React Native (TypeScript)
* Expo Router (or React Navigation)
* React Query (for fetching jobs + stats)
* MMKV or SQLite (for caching jobs list offline)
* Reanimated 3 (for subtle animations: filter changes, list fade/slide)
* Expo Image (no camera needed on this screen)
* Bottom tab navigation already exists: Dashboard, Jobs, Map, More

Assume the TradieTrack app shell already exists and this screen is one tab in the bottom navigation.

## 🔹 1. Screen Structure

Create a `JobsScreen` at:

`app/jobs/index.tsx`  (or equivalent in the router setup)

The layout should include:

1. **Top App Bar**

   * Left: TradieTrack logo
   * Center/left: title “Jobs”
   * Subtext under title: “20 total” (placeholder, use dynamic later)
   * Right side:

     * Search icon
     * Notifications icon with badge
     * Profile avatar
   * On mobile, also include a “+ New Job” primary button aligned to the right *under* the title (like in the screenshot).

2. **Search Bar**

   * Full-width rounded search input with placeholder:
     “Search jobs, clients, addresses…”
   * Light grey background, inner shadow style similar to web.

3. **Status Filter Pills Row**
   A horizontal scroll row of filter chips matching the web:

   * All (20) – highlighted/selected by default
   * New (3)
   * Scheduled (2)
   * In Progress (4)
   * Completed (6)
   * Invoiced (5)

   Each pill:

   * Rounded, small badge with count
   * Selected pill: solid background (blue) with white text
   * Unselected pills: white background, light border, dark text

   Selecting a pill should:

   * Animate slightly with Reanimated (scale/opacity)
   * Filter the Jobs list (for now just filter placeholder data in memory)

4. **Stats Cards Row (Quick Overview)**
   Recreate the four white cards:

   * **Card 1**

     * Icon: “briefcase/box”
     * Big number: `20`
     * Label: “Total Jobs”

   * **Card 2**

     * Icon: clock
     * Big number: `2`
     * Label: “Scheduled”

   * **Card 3**

     * Icon: play/triangle
     * Big number: `4`
     * Label: “In Progress”

   * **Card 4**

     * Icon: check
     * Big number: `6`
     * Label: “Completed”

   Layout:

   * On mobile: 2x2 grid (two cards per row) with spacing similar to screenshot.
   * Cards are rounded, soft shadow, subtle border.

5. **Recent Activity Section**

   Title row:

   * “Recent Activity” (section title)
   * Small grey label “This Week” inside the card.

   Inside the recent activity card:

   * A vertical list of 3 example jobs:

     * “Shower Head Replacement – Today – Invoiced”
     * “Gas Fitting – BBQ – Today – Invoiced”
     * “Laundry Taps Installation – Today – Invoiced”
   * Each row:

     * Blue dot bullet
     * Job title
     * Subtext: “· Today”
     * Right side: pill badge “Invoiced” (purple background, white text)
   * Card should be scrollable if items exceed height (as in screenshot, with a scrollbar/indicator).

6. **All Jobs Section**

   Below Recent Activity:

   * Section header: “All Jobs”
   * Jobs list of cards (at least one or two dummy jobs), each card including:

     * Job title: e.g. “Shower Head Replacement”
     * Status pill: e.g. “Invoiced”, “In Progress”, “Scheduled”, with different colours
     * Short metadata row: client name, address, maybe scheduled time
     * Three-dot menu icon on the right for actions

   Use a simple flat list with Reanimated entrance (fade + slide up).

7. **Bottom Navigation Bar**

   Integrate with existing bottom nav:

   * Tabs: Dashboard, Jobs (selected), Map, More
   * Jobs tab highlighted in blue as per second screenshot.

## 🔹 2. Data + State

Use placeholder/mock data but wire it like a real app:

* Create TypeScript types: `Job`, `JobStatus`, `JobActivityItem`.
* Use React Query with a mock `useJobs` hook that returns:

  * A list of jobs
  * Aggregated stats (total, scheduled, in progress, completed, invoiced)
* Add simple filtering by status when a filter pill is selected.
* Store the last selected filter in React state or Zustand (your choice).

Example statuses: `"new" | "scheduled" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "invoiced"`.

## 🔹 3. Components & File Structure

Please create these components to keep it clean:

```
app/
  jobs/
    index.tsx           // JobsScreen
components/
  jobs/
    JobsHeader.tsx      // title, total count, New Job button
    JobsSearchBar.tsx
    JobStatusFilterBar.tsx
    JobStatCard.tsx
    RecentActivityCard.tsx
    RecentActivityItem.tsx
    JobList.tsx
    JobListItem.tsx
  common/
    SectionHeader.tsx
    BottomTabBar.tsx    // if not already built
hooks/
  useJobs.ts            // mock React Query hook
types/
  jobs.ts               // Job, JobStatus types
```

Use `StyleSheet` or `NativeWind` for styling, but match:

* Colours: soft light grey backgrounds, white cards, blue primary
* Spacing: generous padding and gaps like screenshot
* Fonts: similar hierarchy (title bold, labels subtle grey, numbers clear)

---

## 🔹 4. Animations

Use Reanimated 3 for:

* Filter pill selection (small scale/opacity effect)
* Job list entrance animation (fade + translateY)
* Optional: subtle card press feedback.

---

## 🔹 5. Output Requirements

When you generate code, show:

1. The full `JobsScreen` (`app/jobs/index.tsx`)
2. Component implementations for:

   * `JobStatusFilterBar`
   * `JobStatCard`
   * `RecentActivityCard`
   * `JobList` + `JobListItem`
3. The `useJobs` mock hook using React Query
4. Types for `Job` and `JobStatus`

I will later replace the mock API with a real backend, so add comments where API URLs / queries should go.

---

End of prompt. Generate the full React Native (Expo) code for this Jobs screen now.

---

You can paste that straight into Replit.
When you’re ready for **Job Details** or **New Job** screen prompts, send the next screenshot and I’ll write those too.
