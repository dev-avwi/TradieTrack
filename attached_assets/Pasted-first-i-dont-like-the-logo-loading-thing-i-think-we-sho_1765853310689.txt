first i dont like the logo loading thing, i think we should switch it back to what it was, i figured that that screenshot was just expo and thatd it hd happen on any app, i thought you could change that before app even downloads, that you can changhe that screen where its just the logo, but its fine now. so change that pulsing thing loading, to how it was with logo and the dots, and just make sure all parts like collect payment, stripe connecting setup
also a problem is when im in work page, and i see a job thats done and want tio use the quick create invoice button thats on the job, the job details dont automatically fill in when clicked so im in creating invoice/editing invoice with lijve preview but the details from that job didnt fill in
make sure at all times if theres a call button make sure theres an SMS button, i want to set up SMS from tradie and tradie workers to the app, so that the chat features actually work properly and arent jus thtere for UI and are like actually integratd into the system. So, i want you to use those chats properly and make sure they work through that SMS, and when your in a specific job, chatting to the client make sure you can see client dtails, cuase its more of a job discussion adn not a chat, also with this i want to add features like "im on my way" or "just finished job" texts after completing job with timestamps and that data fills into invoice or something or doesnt have to, you know. so like i want to be able to text clients and my own workers, as a tradie owner within the app, and while textign it should show the phone number, so its trustable and be more trustable like a chat, rather than job discussion and also have those quick actions for saying "im on my way" in the chat to go, so yeah that would be great for the app so just make sure you can SMS or call or email at all times, tradies rather SMS so make SMS a priority, until it comes to quote/invoice sending with templated email, and yeah just make sure the chat features are actually working and not just there for UI and that it works with the clients texting through their SMS app, and since its connected already as phone number, the app recieves these messages and inputs that data, without tradie manually inputting data, it should already connect to worker/tradie phone number, and have those chats ready or are created when tradie/client is sent, and also since it can be more personal or business you never know what chats there'll be. add a delete option, and yeah when in hcta it should show what the job is and client details, name and phone number and address thats it really. but yeah just make all that works and is integrated into the system, cause this would be really good, and within job journey theser chats can be previewed when viewing jobs to make it easier for tradie, like a preview chat option for tradies when in the job to see everything, and make sure owner can see all chats but tradie worker can see chats just to client, group and owner, so that tradie workers dont see chats that arent assigned to them you know. but yeah this will go really great if done properly, especially preview when in view of job journey, so tradie doesnt have to go back and forth
