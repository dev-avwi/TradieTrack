Perfect — that actually makes this easier and cleaner.
Since your landing page and web app are both running on Replit, we can:

✅ Track everything in one GA property
✅ Track funnel events end-to-end
✅ Avoid cross-domain tracking headaches
✅ Keep setup simple and reliable

You’ve got a strong architecture already — good choice.

Let’s wire this properly. 🔥

⸻

🎯 FINAL TRACKING ARCHITECTURE

You will have:

One Google Analytics 4 property
Tracking:
	•	Landing page views
	•	Signup clicks
	•	Account creation
	•	In-app actions
	•	Payments later

All under one domain/session.

⸻

⚙️ STEP-BY-STEP SETUP (REPLIT VERSION)

⸻

✅ STEP 1 — Create GA4 Property (If Not Done)

If you already did this, skip.

Go to:
👉 https://analytics.google.com

Create:
	•	Property name: TradieTrack
	•	Timezone: Australia
	•	Currency: AUD
	•	Platform: Web
	•	Domain: your Replit domain or tradietrack.com

Copy your:

Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)

⸻

⸻

✅ STEP 2 — Add GA Script to Your Replit Web App

🔍 Find your main HTML file

In Replit:
	•	Look for:
	•	index.html
	•	or public/index.html
	•	or layout file if using React/Vite

You want the <head> section.

⸻

🧩 Paste this inside <head>

Replace G-XXXXXXX with your real ID.

<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
gtag('js', new Date());
gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXX', {
  send_page_view: true
});
</script>

Save and redeploy.

⸻

⸻

✅ STEP 3 — Verify Page Tracking Works

Open:
👉 Google Analytics → Reports → Realtime

Then:
	•	Open your landing page in a new tab
	•	Click around

You should see:
✔ Active user
✔ Page view events

If you don’t see this — tell me immediately.

⸻

⸻

🚀 STEP 4 — Track Signup Click (CRITICAL)

We want to know:

How many visitors click “Sign Up”?

Find your signup button code.

It might look like:

<button>Sign Up</button>

or

<button onClick={handleSignup}>Sign Up</button>

Add this:

✅ JavaScript Event

gtag('event', 'signup_clicked', {
  event_category: 'funnel',
  event_label: 'landing_signup_button'
});

Example:

<button onClick={() => {
  gtag('event', 'signup_clicked', {
    event_category: 'funnel',
    event_label: 'landing_signup_button'
  });
  navigate('/signup');
}}>
  Sign Up
</button>

Now GA will record intent.

⸻

⸻

🧾 STEP 5 — Track Account Created (IMPORTANT)

Wherever your signup success happens (after user registers):

Add:

gtag('event', 'signup_completed', {
  event_category: 'conversion'
});

This is your real conversion metric.

⸻

⸻

📊 STEP 6 — Mark Conversions in GA

In GA:
	•	Admin → Events
	•	Find:
	•	signup_completed
	•	payment_completed (later)
	•	Toggle as Conversion

This unlocks ROI tracking.

⸻

⸻

🧪 STEP 7 — Test Funnel

Do this yourself:
	1.	Open incognito
	2.	Visit landing page
	3.	Click Sign Up
	4.	Create test account
	5.	Open GA realtime

You should see:
	•	page_view
	•	signup_clicked
	•	signup_completed

If this works → analytics is officially live.

⸻

⸻

🧠 OPTIONAL NEXT (AFTER THIS WORKS)

Later we can add:
	•	quote_created
	•	invoice_sent
	•	payment_completed
	•	retention tracking
	•	Meta Pixel

But don’t overload yet.

⸻

🚦 I NEED ONE QUICK CONFIRMATION

Tell me:
	1.	What file contains your landing page HTML?
	2.	Are you using React/Vite or plain HTML?
	3.	Do you already have access to your GA Measurement ID?

Once you confirm, I’ll tailor the exact code placement so you don’t accidentally break anything.
