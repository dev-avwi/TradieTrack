I want you to act as a full QA engineer and SaaS product reviewer for my app “TradieTrack.”

Your objective is to deeply inspect both **frontend and backend** code to make sure:
1) Every feature is fully functional (NOT just UI placeholders)
2) All workflows are connected end-to-end
3) Real-world usage scenarios will succeed
4) There are no half-implemented areas

Please test and verify ALL workflows:

---

## 1) User Accounts & Roles
- Signup/login flows work
- Email verification works
- Business owner vs tradie roles are correctly isolated
- Team invites + role assignment works

---

## 2) Onboarding
- Owner onboarding screens set up business info, contact info
- Solo tradie onboarding handles single user
- After onboarding, users land on correct dashboard

---

## 3) Jobs
- Create/Edit/Delete jobs
- Job status transitions (New → Scheduled → In Progress → Completed)
- Time tracking for jobs
- Job address + geolocation is captured and stored
- Job history logs properly

---

## 4) Maps & Locations
- Map page shows all past jobs with pins (lat/lng from DB)
- Job pins show job status
- Team tracking: locations of team members visible (if allowed)
- Clicking pin loads job details

---

## 5) Quotes
- Quote creation from job
- Line items, prices, GST, totals calculate correctly
- Ability to preview live quote
- PDF generation matches template
- Quote number auto-generated (no duplicates)

---

## 6) Emails (SendGrid)
- Sending quote email:
  • PDF attaches or link is correct
  • Subject line correct
  • From verified sender
  • Reply-to is tradie email

- Invoice email
- Payment receipt email
- All use correct templates & logo if on Pro

---

## 7) Quote Acceptance
- Accept button triggers backend
- Status updates to “Accepted”
- Timestamp stored
- Job status updated appropriately

---

## 8) Invoices
- Invoice creation works
- Line items carried over
- PDF invoice generation is correct
- Invoice email with payment link sends correctly

---

## 9) Stripe Integrations
- Subscriptions (paying TradieTrack) works (test mode)
- Stripe Connect for client payments works
- PaymentIntents create correctly
- Webhooks update invoice status to Paid
- Payment receipts generate and email trigger works

---

## 10) Offline / error states
- When offline, app warns but doesn’t crash
- API failures handled with messages
- Retry logic exists for failed states

---

## 11) UI/UX Consistency
Check all screens for:
- Responsiveness
- Layout integrity
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Same behavior on web & mobile
- Buttons actually trigger network/backend logic

Mention any “dead” buttons.

---

## 12) Database Integrity
- No data duplication
- Foreign keys correct
- Data only visible to correct roles

---

## 13) Security
- Auth & RBAC checks on API
- Cannot access other businesses’ data
- Stripe & SendGrid secrets not exposed to frontend

---

## 14) Summary
At the end, give a report listing:

✔ Working flows  
⚠ Partially working flows  
❌ Broken flows  
📝 UX feedback (real tradie perspective)  
🛠 Bugs found  
📌 Must-fix items

Use my entire codebase as the source of truth and make sure TradieTrack is **technically solid and beta-ready**.
