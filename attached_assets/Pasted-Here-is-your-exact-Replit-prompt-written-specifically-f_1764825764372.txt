Here is **your exact Replit prompt** written specifically for the **TradieTrack dashboard screen**, using the screenshots you provided.

Just **copy + paste this whole thing into Replit** and it will build the Dashboard UI in React Native (Expo) to match your web version as closely as possible.

# ✅ **Replit Prompt — TradieTrack Dashboard (Exact Copy-Paste)**

**PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT:**

---

I am rebuilding the TradieTrack **Dashboard** screen from my web app into a **React Native (Expo) mobile app**.
I want you to recreate the UI **as close as possible to the web layout**, but optimised for mobile.

Here are the screenshots showing exactly what the Dashboard looks like:
**(Assume these two images show the complete layout)**

* A full desktop dashboard with sidebar, top bar, greeting, quick stats, quick actions, and today’s jobs list.
* A mobile UI example showing how elements collapse into bottom navigation.

### 🎯 **Build This Using My Mobile Stack**

Use this tech stack:

* Expo + React Native (TypeScript)
* Expo Router (or React Navigation)
* React Query (for fetching dashboard data)
* MMKV or SQLite (for offline storage)
* Reanimated 3 (for smooth card animations)
* Expo Image / Expo Camera (not needed on this screen but keep ready)
* Expo Notifications (not needed on this screen but keep ready)

### 📌 **Your job: Build the ENTIRE Dashboard screen UI**

Recreate the following elements in React Native:

---

# 🔹 **1. Top Navigation Bar**

Match the style shown in the screenshot:

* TradieTrack logo left
* Icons on right: search, notifications, profile avatar
* Light grey header background
* Thin bottom border

---

# 🔹 **2. Greeting Section**

Just like the web:

**Good afternoon, Ayden**
“You have 3 jobs scheduled today”

Use bold large font for greeting, smaller grey text for subtitle.

---

# 🔹 **3. App Promo Card (Blue Gradient Box)**

Recreate the EXACT layout:

* TradieTrack logo circle on left
* “TradieTrack – Free during Beta” pill
* “Built for Australian tradies”
* Feature icons + text:

  * GST Compliant
  * Secure Payments
  * Encrypted

Rounded corners, soft gradient background, thin border.

---

# 🔹 **4. Quick Stats Section**

Two rows of cards, each card with:

**Row 1:**

* Jobs Today
* Overdue

**Row 2:**

* Quotes Pending
* This Month ($0)

Each card should match the web look:

* White card
* Rounded corners
* Icon on left
* Number large
* Label below

Use a 2-column grid on mobile.

---

# 🔹 **5. Quick Actions (Buttons Row)**

Recreate the three pill buttons exactly:

* Job (blue active)
* Quote (white)
* Invoice (white with $ icon)

These should be horizontally scrollable on small screens.

---

# 🔹 **6. “Today” Section Title**

“Today” on the left
“View All >” on the right

Keep spacing identical.

---

# 🔹 **7. Job Card (The Blue-ish Card)**

Recreate the exact job layout:

* Time badge (3:14 AM)
* Job status pill (“In Progress”)
* Job title: “Sewer Line Inspection”
* Client name (David White)
* Location (icon + address)
* Entire card rounded with soft shadow
* Blue vertical highlight bar on the left

Make it animated with Reanimated (fade-in + slide-up).

---

# 🔹 **8. Bottom Navigation Bar**

Use mobile layout shown in the second screenshot:

Tabs:

* Dashboard
* Jobs
* Map
* More

Use icons + labels exactly like shown.

---

# 🔹 **INSTRUCTIONS FOR OUTPUT**

When generating code, include:

1. A full folder structure:

```
app/
  dashboard/
    index.tsx
  components/
    QuickStatCard.tsx
    JobCard.tsx
    ActionButton.tsx
  hooks/
    useDashboard.ts
  styles/
    colors.ts
    spacing.ts
```

2. Provide the **complete Dashboard screen code** (`index.tsx`)

3. Provide all supporting components:

* QuickStatCard
* JobCard
* ActionButton
* BottomNavigation

4. Use dummy placeholder data (React Query mocked)

5. Use clean, modern styling:

* Tailwind (via NativeWind) OR StyleSheet (your choice)
* Spacing + colours should match screenshot aesthetic

6. No backend wiring yet — just UI and placeholder query hooks.

---

# 🧩 **Final Goal**

Produce a **pixel-converted React Native version** of the TradieTrack dashboard:

* Same layout
* Same components
* Same branding
* Same spacing
* Same card design
* Same bottom bar navigation

But fully built in Expo + React Native.
