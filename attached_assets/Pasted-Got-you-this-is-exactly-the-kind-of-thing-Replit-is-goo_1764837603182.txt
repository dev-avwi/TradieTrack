Got you — this is exactly the kind of thing Replit is good at if you tell it clearly.

Below is a **single master prompt** you can paste straight into Replit AI to make it:

* check **mobile vs desktop parity**
* fix layouts (no broken/half-done mobile views)
* ensure **buttons, nav, sidebars, search, map, PDFs** all work properly on phones
* keep everything consistent with your web app design.

Just copy–paste this into Replit AI in your TradieTrack project:

### 🧠 REPLIT MASTER PROMPT — “MAKE MOBILE MATCH WEB (UI + FEATURES) FOR TRADIETRACK”

I’m building a SaaS app called **TradieTrack** for tradies (jobs, quotes, invoices, maps, chat, etc.).

Right now the **desktop/web view** is ahead of the **mobile view**.
I want you to make sure the **mobile app (phone layout) works and looks as good as the desktop app**, with full feature parity.

Act as a **front-end engineer + UX QA**.

Please:

---

## 1️⃣ Scan the whole codebase for layouts & navigation

* Find:

  * main layout components (shell, page wrappers)
  * desktop sidebar / top nav
  * mobile nav / bottom nav / hamburger
  * all main pages: Dashboard/Activity, Jobs, Job Detail, Clients, Quotes, Invoices, Calendar, Map, Chat, Settings, Billing, etc.

Identify where:

* desktop layout is well-designed
* mobile layout is incomplete, broken, or not aligned with desktop.

---

## 2️⃣ Unify desktop + mobile UI using the same design system

I want:

* **Desktop**: sidebar/top-nav layout (what I already have)
* **Mobile**: bottom-nav / simple header layout

Make sure:

* All major pages use a **shared layout component** that:

  * handles padding/margins
  * uses proper max-width
  * works at all breakpoints (e.g. 320px–1440px)
* There are **no leftover empty columns** or unused grid areas on mobile (fix that “big blank right column” issue everywhere).
* Typography, spacing, and card styles are consistent between web and mobile.

If you find custom CSS or layout code that only suits desktop, refactor to use responsive patterns (Tailwind breakpoints, flexbox, grid, etc.).

---

## 3️⃣ Navigation parity (sidebar vs bottom nav)

On **desktop**:

* Sidebar/top nav can stay as-is (or be cleaned up).

On **mobile**:

* Ensure the **bottom nav** (or mobile nav) provides access to the same core sections:

  * Home/Activity
  * Jobs
  * Clients
  * Map / Schedule
  * More/Settings

Check:

* Every bottom nav item routes correctly.
* Active tab is clearly highlighted.
* No page is “desktop-only”.

If there are nav items that appear in one mode but not the other, fix or explain why.

## 4️⃣ Buttons, actions, and interactions: same behaviour on mobile

For **every major action**:

* “New Job”
* “New Quote”
* “New Invoice”
* “Send Quote”
* “Send Invoice”
* “Convert to Invoice”
* “Mark as Paid”
* “Open Map”
* “Open Chat”
* “Start Timer” (time tracking)
* “Save”, “Edit”, “Delete”

Check:

1. The **button exists on mobile** (not only desktop).
2. It calls the **same handler / API**.
3. Labels are clear and tappable on a phone.
4. Touch targets are large enough (44px minimum height).

If any feature is present in the desktop UI but missing or non-functional on mobile, either:

* implement it properly on mobile, or
* hide it from mobile for beta and mark as TODO in comments.

---

## 5️⃣ Search + filters: must work on mobile too

Any search bars or filters (e.g. Jobs search, Clients search, Quotes/Invoices filters):

* Must be visible and usable on phones.
* Should not overflow off-screen.
* Must actually filter results via real data, not just UI/placeholder.

Check:

* Jobs search/filter on mobile.
* Clients search/filter.
* Quotes/Invoices search/filter.
* Any “status filter” chips (Scheduled / In progress / Completed).

Fix anything that’s desktop-only or broken on narrow screens.

---

## 6️⃣ Map page & location systems (owner + team)

I want a **proper map page** for owners/managers that works on mobile AND desktop.

It should:

* Show job locations across the city/region (using job address/coordinates).
* Use proper map rendering (e.g. Leaflet/Mapbox/Google Maps wrapper).
* Show markers with job status labels (e.g. Scheduled, In Progress, Completed).
* Optionally show tradie locations (team members) if that feature exists.

Please:

1. Find the map page/component.
2. Confirm:

   * Job addresses are stored in DB.
   * Coordinates (lat/lng) are stored if geocoding is used.
   * Map markers are created from real job data.
3. On mobile:

   * Map is full-width, no weird cropping.
   * No horizontal scroll.
   * You can tap markers to see job details (client name, status, time).
4. Ensure there is NO “fake map UI” that doesn’t use real data.

If there’s any “Use current location” or tracking button:

* Confirm it calls actual code.
* If not fully implemented, hide it or label “coming soon” for beta.

---

## 7️⃣ Chat: team chat + job chat must work on mobile

I have:

* **Job-specific chat** (per job)
* **Team / group chat**

Check:

* On mobile, you can access both:

  * From a Job detail page → Job Chat.
  * From a main Chat/Team section → group chat.
* Messages are:

  * Rendered clearly.
  * Scrollable.
  * Showing sender + timestamp.
* Input bar is usable (not hidden behind keyboard, not offscreen).
* Backend calls exist and messages are saved, not just displayed in local component state.

If desktop chat has features mobile doesn't (e.g. attachments, emoji, etc.), either add them or leave a clean, minimal mobile subset that works reliably.

---

## 8️⃣ Time tracking + location for jobs

If there is any **time tracking** or **location tracking**:

* Start/Stop timer buttons must work on mobile.
* Timer values must be stored server-side per job (not just local state).
* Job detail should show logged time clearly.

For location:

* If the app lets you log job location or tradie location:

  * Confirm that pressing the button updates the DB.
  * Confirm it appears later on the map or in job history.

If these are not fully implemented, hide unfinished UI for beta.

---

## 9️⃣ PDF generation & preview must be mobile-friendly

For quotes & invoices:

* Check that PDF generation logic is the same regardless of device.
* Mobile view should offer:

  * Clear “Preview PDF” button.
  * Clear “Send to client” button.
* On small screens:

  * PDF preview should not break layout.
  * If inline viewer is clunky, use a link / open-in-new-tab style.

Confirm:

* PDF templates use real data (business logo, ABN, client info, items, GST).
* No fake/placeholder PDFs in the mobile path.
* The same template engine is used for both desktop and mobile flows.

---

## 🔟 Responsive behaviour: fix all visual issues on mobile widths

Test and fix for common breakpoints:

* 320px / 360px (small phones)
* 390–414px (normal iPhones)
* 768px (tablet)

For each main page:

* Ensure no horizontal scrolling.
* Fix any overflowing text or cards.
* Ensure grids stack properly on mobile (e.g. 2×2 dashboard → 1×4 on phone).
* Ensure modals/sheets fit nicely and are closable.

If necessary, add mobile-specific layout adjustments (`md:`, `lg:` breakpoints, etc.).

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Role-based onboarding & dashboards

There are at least two roles:

* **Owner/Manager**
* **Tradie/Worker**

Check:

* Onboarding flow asks enough questions to determine role (solo vs team, etc.).
* Owner dashboard shows:

  * Overview metrics.
  * Map / team view.
  * Financials.
* Tradie dashboard shows:

  * Today’s jobs.
  * Next job.
  * Quick access to job details, chat, and map.

On mobile:

* Both dashboards must be usable and not broken.
* Ensure role checks exist so tradies don’t see owner-only pages (billing, business settings).

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ General polish & “no half-done features” rule

Go through the app and:

* Identify any **half-done features** that are visible in the UI (buttons, menu items, tabs).
* If a feature is not fully wired (no backend, no real logic), either:

  * Complete the implementation, or
  * Hide it for now and add a TODO comment.

Goal: **Everything a beta user can see should actually work**, especially on mobile.

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Final summary

After changes, produce a short summary (in comments or console) of:

* ✅ Which main screens are now fully mobile-ready & feature-complete:

  * Home/Activity
  * Jobs list + Job detail
  * Clients
  * Quotes
  * Invoices
  * Calendar/Schedule
  * Map
  * Chat (job + team)
  * Settings/Billing

* 🛠 Any remaining known issues or desktop-only features that are intentionally hidden on mobile for now.

Make sure the codebase represents a **technically solid beta** where the mobile experience is as complete and polished as the desktop experience for all the key TradieTrack workflows.

---

You can paste that into Replit as-is.

If you want after that, we can do a **phone-only “walkthrough script”** for you to literally pick up your mobile, pretend to be an owner and then a tradie, and tap through everything like a real day on site.
