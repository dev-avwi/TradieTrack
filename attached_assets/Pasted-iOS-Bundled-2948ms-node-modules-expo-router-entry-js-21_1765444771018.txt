 WARN  expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead of Expo Go. Read more at https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/.
 WARN  `expo-notifications` functionality is not fully supported in Expo Go:
We recommend you instead use a development build to avoid limitations. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dev-client.
