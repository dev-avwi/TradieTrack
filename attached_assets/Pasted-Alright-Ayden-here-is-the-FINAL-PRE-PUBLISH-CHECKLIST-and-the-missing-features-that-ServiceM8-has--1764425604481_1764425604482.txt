Alright Ayden — here is the FINAL PRE-PUBLISH CHECKLIST and the missing features that ServiceM8 has that TradieTrack does NOT (so you can decide what you MUST add now vs what can wait for v2).

This is the cleanest, most founder-ready breakdown you’ll ever get.

⸻

⭐ What TradieTrack ALREADY HAS (and is solid enough for real tradies)

✔ Jobs

✔ Clients

✔ Quotes

✔ Invoices

✔ Calendar

✔ Team Accounts

✔ Job Chat

✔ Team Chat

✔ File Uploads

✔ Time Tracking

✔ Expenses

✔ Templates

✔ Business Setup (ABN, logo, etc.)

✔ Stripe Connect (payments)

✔ SendGrid (email sending)

✔ PDF generator

✔ Mobile-friendly UI

✔ Roles/permissions

✔ Clean and familiar job workflow

This is a complete MVP, and honestly more polished than some paid apps.

You can launch the beta with this.

⸻

⭐ Now — what ServiceM8 does that you DON’T (yet)

These are the extra features ServiceM8 uses as competitive edges.
I’ll divide them into:
	•	Required for launch
	•	Optional but nice
	•	Advanced / postpone until later

This way you know exactly what to prioritise.

⸻

🔥 A. REQUIRED BEFORE PUBLISHING (Missing pieces)

These are the features tradies EXPECT from ANY job management tool.

1. Job Status Workflow

ServiceM8 uses steps like:
	•	New
	•	Scheduled
	•	In Progress
	•	Completed
	•	Invoiced

You need to make job statuses matter visually:
	•	Status badge on job card
	•	Drag-to-update or quick actions
	•	Move job automatically when quote accepted

This is expected.

⸻

2. Customer Acceptance Flow

ServiceM8 lets customers:
	•	Accept quotes
	•	Decline quotes
	•	Leave notes
	•	Signed acceptance (optional)

TradieTrack MUST have:
	•	A quote acceptance link
	•	Timestamp storage
	•	“Accepted by ___”

Otherwise real tradies won’t trust the process.

⸻

3. Inspection of PDF quality

You MUST ensure:
	•	clean spacing
	•	no broken layout
	•	proper typography
	•	correct GST
	•	ABN always visible
	•	neat tables

This is what customers judge instantly.

⸻

4. Email Templates

You need 4 pre-written emails:
	•	Quote sent
	•	Invoice sent
	•	Payment receipt
	•	Job confirmation

Tradies hate typing emails.

⸻

5. Activity Feed (Basic Version)

Even a simple feed like:
	•	“Quote sent to Sarah”
	•	“Invoice paid”
	•	“Job scheduled for Tuesday”
	•	“Client accepted quote”

Makes the app feel alive and modern.

⸻

⭐ B. OPTIONAL BUT VERY GOOD TO ADD (ServiceM8 strengths)

6. Job Photos / Attachments UI upgrade

ServiceM8 has:
	•	Camera button
	•	Easy photo capturing
	•	Before/after section

You already support file upload
→ You just need a better gallery layout.

⸻

7. Workflow Automation (light version)

ServiceM8 uses automations heavily, but you don’t need a full system.

Just add:
	•	Auto-send quote follow-up (24 hrs later)
	•	Auto-send invoice reminder (7 days)

This alone is huge.

⸻

8. Submissions / Checklists

Basic checklist templates for:
	•	electrical compliance
	•	plumbing checklist
	•	photo checklist

These are “Pro features” but easy to add from templates.

⸻

9. Mobile Dashboard Polish

Align with iOS feel:
	•	Bigger headings
	•	Softer cards
	•	Today’s Job panel
	•	Activity feed
	•	Last 3 updates

⸻

⭐ C. ADVANCED FEATURES (add later)

These are big and NOT needed for launch but great upgrades.

10. Map View / Route Optimizing

Showing:
	•	job locations
	•	routing
	•	ETA
	•	map pins

This is expensive and not required early.

⸻

11. Drag-and-Drop Scheduling Board

ServiceM8 has a “dispatch board”.

You can add later as a desktop-only feature:
	•	Calendar timeline
	•	Drag job into time slot
	•	Assign to teammate

⸻

12. Tap to Pay on iPhone

You can do this later via:
	•	Stripe Terminal
	•	Apple Tap-to-Pay API
	•	iOS merchant validation

Not required for launch.

⸻

13. Accounting Integrations (Xero, QuickBooks)

Add when you hit ~100+ paying users.

⸻

⭐ FINAL PUBLISHING DECISION

You are 100% ready to publish a beta IF you add these:

⭐ MUST-HAVE BEFORE PUBLISHING
	1.	Quote acceptance flow
	2.	Clean PDF templates
	3.	Email templates
	4.	Job status workflow
	5.	Activity feed (simple version)
	6.	Remove unused right column (fix spacing)
	7.	Clean iOS-style mobile UI for home screen

Everything else can come AFTER launch.

This makes your app legit, trustworthy, and comparable to ServiceM8 for small tradies.
