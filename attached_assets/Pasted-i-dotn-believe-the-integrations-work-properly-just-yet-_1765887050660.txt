i dotn believe the integrations work properly just yet it isnt clear to tradie and isnt going to work properly ye ti think
implement these: with like AI or maps to find best route for your day comparing to where you are, and whats the schedule for the day so everything goes into account tog ive tradie the best schedule 
implement ehse: Areas for Improvement:

No voice AI assistant (Siri integration)
AI suggestions could be more contextual
Automation rules UI could be simpler
i dont think the integrations are still that great cause theres no option for sendgrid and twilio yet in integrations so actually make sure it integrates with everything and when in jobs chathub, make it more like you textign them instead of job discussion, job discussion is weird and i feel like real texting as SMS but connected within the app and syncd is way better and when change job discussion kind of thing to more of a messaging platform service, make sure to show client details like phone number, email and stuff. so its more of a everything in one app, and not just there for UI so check other things like this, and also make sure Xero MYOB actually are integrated within the app and work properly, that they arent there for UI and credits, that they actually benefit the tradie, thats what all parts should be so check all features, in the app on a test workflow to see if they impact or benefit the tradie, and find parts where it worsens the app experience and also just actually make sure that themes, documents, jobs and everything are syncd to accounts so when logged into other account, everything from the mobile app syncs to web app, and everything from web app syncs to mobile app, and everything from tradietrack is syncd to the integrations and vice versa so everything talks to each other and is beneficial
i dont believe the AI assistant is actually an assistant cuase those things you told me like draft professional emails, quotes, and analysis of job photos, they arent really there and i want to be able to test them so actually let me test them in th emock data workflow, so do one last E2E test on full flow with all parts making sure its clear to tradies what they need to do, actually let them do it and make sure that its easy to get things to clients like payment and everything, so everything works smooth
