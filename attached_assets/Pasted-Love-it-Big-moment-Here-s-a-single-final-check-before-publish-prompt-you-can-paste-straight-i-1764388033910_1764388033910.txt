Love it. Big moment. 🎉
Here’s a single “final check before publish” prompt you can paste straight into Replit.

This tells Replit to:
	•	Test all core features we planned
	•	Audit UI/UX for tradies
	•	Fix remaining layout issues
	•	Compare patterns vs ServiceM8 / Tradify / ServiceTitan
	•	Get the app into “ready to show real tradies” shape

🧠 REPLIT PROMPT — FINAL FULL TEST & PRE-PUBLISH AUDIT FOR TRADIETRACK

I’m building a SaaS web app called TradieTrack for tradies (plumbers, sparkies, handymen) to manage:
	•	jobs
	•	clients
	•	quotes
	•	invoices
	•	calendar/schedule
	•	team & roles
	•	job chat & team chat
	•	files/photos
	•	settings
	•	billing & payments

I believe I’m ready to publish, but I want a full final audit and test of everything before I show real tradies or start charging.

Act as:
	•	a QA tester
	•	a UX designer who understands tradies
	•	and a SaaS product reviewer

Please go through the whole codebase and app and do the following:

⸻

1️⃣ Confirm all planned core features work end-to-end

Find and test (in code and flows) these features:

Onboarding & Auth
	•	Signup & login
	•	Basic onboarding (business name, trade, solo/team)
	•	Owner/manager/tradie roles connected to business

Business Settings
	•	Business info (name, ABN, logo, phone, email, address)
	•	Email verification state (if implemented)
	•	Billing/Subscription information (plan, status)
	•	Payments/Stripe Connect status
	•	Team management (invite, roles)

Clients & Jobs
	•	Create/edit/delete clients
	•	Create/edit/update jobs
	•	Assign jobs to specific tradies
	•	Jobs list (filters, search if present)
	•	Job detail view:
	•	notes
	•	status
	•	attached files/photos
	•	job chat

Quotes
	•	Create quote for a client/job
	•	Line items (description, qty, unit price, total)
	•	GST calculation (if enabled)
	•	Auto-generated quote number
	•	Quote status (draft, sent, accepted, declined)
	•	Quote preview (must look professional)
	•	Send quote via email or share link (backend logic)

Invoices
	•	Convert quote → invoice (if implemented)
	•	Create invoice from scratch (if allowed)
	•	Line items and totals
	•	GST clearly shown as included/added
	•	Auto-generated invoice number
	•	Invoice statuses: draft, sent, paid, overdue
	•	Invoice preview/PDF (must look like a real business invoice)

Calendar / Schedule
	•	Jobs shown by date
	•	Easy to see today/this week’s jobs
	•	Clicking a job in calendar takes you to job details

Chat & Communication
	•	Job chat (messages linked to a job)
	•	Team chat / general chat (if implemented)
	•	Messages created/saved correctly, easy to read

Files & Photos
	•	Upload file/photo to job (if implemented)
	•	File links or previews visible on job detail

If any of these flows are incomplete, broken, or still using mock data, fix them or clearly mark them as “not ready” in code comments.

⸻

2️⃣ UI / UX Audit — does this feel clean & modern for a tradie?

Go through all main pages and check:

Layout consistency
	•	All pages use a consistent layout container
	•	No weird empty right-hand column or unused grid space
	•	Spacing (padding/margins) is consistent across pages
	•	Content is not squeezed onto the left side

Pages to check:
	•	Dashboard
	•	Jobs list
	•	Job detail
	•	Clients
	•	Quotes
	•	Invoices
	•	Calendar
	•	Chat
	•	Settings (Business, Billing, Payments, Team, More)

Dashboard
	•	Uses a 2×2 widget/card layout on desktop, 1 column on mobile
	•	Shows useful info for tradies:
	•	jobs today
	•	pending quotes
	•	unpaid invoices
	•	maybe recent activity

Readability
	•	Text is large enough and clear
	•	Button labels use simple language:
	•	“Create job”
	•	“Send quote”
	•	“Convert to invoice”
	•	“Mark as paid”
	•	No jargon or developer language (no “submit entity”, etc.)

Mobile
	•	Layout works on a narrow screen
	•	No horizontal scrolling
	•	Navigation is easy (e.g. bottom nav bar)

Any layout using an extra column or leaving unused space on the right should be refactored to match the clean layout used by the “More/Settings” page.

⸻

3️⃣ Legitimacy of quotes, invoices & emails

Compare the feel and structure of my quotes & invoices to what top apps like ServiceM8, Tradify, ServiceTitan use (based on your training and knowledge).

Check that:

Quotes include:
	•	Business logo & name
	•	ABN
	•	Contact info (phone, email, address)
	•	Client name & address
	•	Quote number
	•	Issue date & expiry date
	•	Clear description and line items
	•	GST breakdown (if applicable)
	•	Final total
	•	Notes/terms section
	•	Status (draft/sent/accepted)
	•	Are visually neat and professional

Invoices include:
	•	“INVOICE” clearly visible
	•	Invoice number
	•	Business logo & details
	•	Client details
	•	Issue date & due date
	•	Job reference (if possible)
	•	Line items & totals
	•	GST label
	•	Payment instructions or “Pay now” button (if online payments enabled)
	•	Status (draft/sent/paid/overdue)

Emails (if templates are set up):
	•	Subject lines are clear (e.g. “Your quote from Cairns Plumbing via TradieTrack”)
	•	From: TradieTrack for {BusinessName} <no-reply@tradietrack.com>
	•	Reply-To: tradie’s business email
	•	Body looks professional and not spammy

If anything feels “student project” instead of real tradie business software, improve it.

⸻

4️⃣ Production integrations sanity check

Verify, in code and configuration, that:

Stripe Subscriptions (tradie → me)
	•	Uses environment variables for keys
	•	Checkout session endpoints are correct
	•	Webhooks update subscription_tier, subscription_status, current_period_end in business table
	•	Billing page shows correct plan & status

Stripe Connect (customer → tradie)
	•	Connect onboarding flow exists (button → account link → Stripe Express)
	•	stripe_connect_account_id, charges_enabled, payouts_enabled stored correctly
	•	Invoice online payments (if implemented) use PaymentIntent with:
	•	application_fee_amount for my platform fee
	•	transfer_data.destination for tradie’s account
	•	Webhooks mark invoices as paid on successful payment

SendGrid
	•	API key only used server-side
	•	App-level emails and customer emails use separate helpers
	•	Customer emails use From: TradieTrack for {BusinessName} with Reply-To tradie’s email

Security
	•	No secrets in frontend
	•	RLS rules are configured so users only access their own business data
	•	Backend checks user role and business affiliation on sensitive routes

⸻

5️⃣ Performance & error handling

Check that:
	•	Pages show loading states (no blank white screens while fetching)
	•	Errors show friendly messages (e.g. “Couldn’t save job, please try again.”)
	•	No obvious console errors in key flows
	•	Initial page load is not extremely slow

If there are wasteful or obviously heavy operations, optimize them.

⸻

6️⃣ Comparison vs top tradie apps (ServiceM8, Tradify, etc.)

Using your knowledge of common patterns in top trade management apps:
	•	Check if my app follows standard patterns for:
	•	navigation
	•	job detail layout
	•	quote & invoice flows
	•	calendar layout
	•	client management
	•	Identify any critical missing feature that would prevent a tradie from fully switching from something like ServiceM8/Tradify for a small team (1–5 users).

Do NOT try to match every advanced feature; focus on MVP parity:
	•	Reliable jobs
	•	Clean quotes
	•	Legit invoices
	•	Basic schedule
	•	Basic team roles
	•	Simple comms

If something is missing that tradies expect as basic, point it out in comments or a summary.

⸻

7️⃣ Final pre-publish summary

After making fixes, generate a summary (in comments or console) of:
	1.	✅ Which core flows are fully working and tested
	2.	⚠️ Which parts are still prototype/rough and should be marked “beta”
	3.	🛠 Any TODOs that must be done soon after launch
	4.	🎯 Whether the app feels:
	•	Ready for 3–5 real tradie beta testers
	•	Ready for a wider “public beta”
	•	Or needs more core work before anyone uses it

Use this entire prompt as the final QA + UX + production readiness spec and bring TradieTrack to a clean, modern, tradie-friendly state suitable for a real launch.

⸻

You can paste that straight into Replit’s AI.

If you want, after Replit’s done and you tweak a bit more, you can give me your latest URL + a quick written description of how each main page looks and I’ll help you tune messaging, layout, and “tradie trust” even more before you show it to anyone in Cairns.
