1️⃣ FEATURES THAT CAN PUT YOU WAY AHEAD

Most tradie apps compete on features.
You should compete on time saved, thinking removed, and stress reduced.

🧠 A. AI FEATURES (THIS IS YOUR BIG ADVANTAGE)
🔥 1. AI QUOTING FROM PHOTOS + VOICE (HUGE)

Why this wins:

Tradies hate sitting down to quote.

Tradify & ServiceM8 still rely on manual item entry.

What TradieTrack does better:

Tradie takes photos + records a voice note on-site

AI:

identifies job type (plumbing, AC, electrical)

suggests line items (labour, materials)

gives a price range (tradie confirms, not types)

👉 Result: quoting time drops from 20–30 mins → 2–3 mins

This alone can beat both apps.

🔥 2. AUTO JOB NOTES & INVOICES (NO TYPING)

After a job:

Tradie uploads photos

AI writes:

job summary

invoice description

client-friendly explanation

Tradify & ServiceM8 make you type everything.

🔥 3. “NEXT ACTION” AI ASSISTANT

Every job shows:

“Next best action”

Examples:

“Send invoice – job finished 2 days ago”

“Client hasn’t approved quote”

“Deposit unpaid”

“Follow up overdue job”

Tradies don’t think in dashboards — they think in what do I do next.

⚡ B. SPEED & SIMPLICITY (WHERE INCUMBENTS FAIL)
🔥 4. 5-TAP RULE (THIS IS BIG)

Any common action must take ≤ 5 taps:

New job

Add photos

Send invoice

Mark job complete

Tradify & ServiceM8 are powerful but bloated.

Your app must feel:

“Open → tap → done”

🔥 5. OFFLINE-FIRST THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

Real tradie problem:

No signal on job sites

TradieTrack:

Works fully offline

Syncs automatically later

Shows “Saved offline ✓”

Tradify claims this, but it’s clunky.

🔥 6. INSTANT JOB CREATION

From:

Phone call

SMS

Website enquiry

Voice note

Example:

Tradie pastes a message → app turns it into a job

Website form → auto creates job with client + address

Less admin = more love.

🧱 C. FEATURES FOR GROWING TEAMS (WITHOUT COMPLEXITY)
🔥 7. SMART SCHEDULING (NOT JUST A CALENDAR)

Auto suggest job times based on:

job type

location

technician availability

Warns:

“This job overlaps”

“This day is overbooked”

Tradify scheduling is powerful but manual.

🔥 8. JOB PROFITABILITY THAT’S EASY

Instead of complex reports:

Each job shows:

Revenue

Estimated cost

Profit (simple green/red)

Tradies don’t want spreadsheets.

💰 D. MONEY & CASH FLOW FEATURES (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔥 9. DEPOSIT-FIRST INVOICING

Quote automatically includes:

deposit option

balance due on completion

One-tap “request deposit”

This massively helps tradies’ cash flow.

🔥 10. PAYMENT CHASER (POLITE BUT EFFECTIVE)

Auto reminders:

“Invoice due today”

“Still unpaid”

Message tone:

friendly

professional

not awkward

This saves uncomfortable conversations.

2️⃣ HOW TO POLISH TRADIETRACK SO IT FEELS “PERFECT”

Features won’t win alone. Polish will.

🎨 A. VISUAL & UX POLISH
✅ 1. DESIGN RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Big buttons

High contrast

No tiny text

Dark mode (tradies love it)

Works with one hand

Tradify looks “enterprise”.
You should look friendly, fast, modern.

✅ 2. ZERO CONFUSION SCREENS

Every screen answers:

What am I looking at?

What should I do next?

If a tradie hesitates → redesign.

🚀 B. ONBOARDING THAT HOOKS USERS
🔥 3. 10-MINUTE WIN

Within 10 minutes, a new user should:

create a job

add photos

send a quote/invoice

If not → they churn.

🔥 4. DONE-FOR-YOU TEMPLATES

Preload:

common job types

standard pricing blocks

invoice wording

Blank screens kill motivation.

🧠 C. PSYCHOLOGICAL POLISH (THIS IS UNDERRATED)
🔥 5. FEEDBACK EVERYWHERE

“Saved ✓”

“Invoice sent ✓”

“Payment received 💰”

Micro-feedback makes the app feel reliable.

🔥 6. LANGUAGE MATTERS

Use tradie language:

“Jobs”

“Cash”

“Get paid”

“Next job”

Avoid corporate terms:

“Resources”

“Workflow optimisation”

“KPIs”

🧪 D. QUALITY & TRUST
🔥 7. BUGS ARE A DEALBREAKER

Tradies tolerate:
❌ missing features
❌ ugly UI
❌ slow load times

They do NOT tolerate bugs.

Stability > features.

🔥 8. SPEED BENCHMARKS

App opens < 2 seconds

Job loads instantly

Camera opens instantly

This matters more than fancy charts.

🧠 REALITY CHECK (IMPORTANT)

You do not need all of this at launch.

MVP must nail:

✔️ Fast jobs
✔️ Photos
✔️ Quotes
✔️ Invoices
✔️ Simple scheduling
✔️ One AI feature (quoting OR job notes)

Add the rest over time.

🔥 FINAL TRUTH

If TradieTrack:

saves more time

reduces thinking

removes admin stress

feels faster & simpler

Then yes, it can absolutely steal users from both Tradify and ServiceM8.

Not overnight — but steadily.
