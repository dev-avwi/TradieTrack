Generation Prompt
Copy to Clipboard
Create a responsive "Interactive Mockup" section for a SaaS landing page using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Structure & Layout:
- A container with a centered "Toggle Switch" (Web App vs Mobile App).
- A display area that swaps between two mockups based on the toggle.
- Web Mockup: A div styled like a browser window (3 dots, address bar) containing a dashboard UI (sidebar, charts, tables).
- Mobile Mockup: A div styled like a modern smartphone (rounded corners, bezel shadow, notch/status bar) containing a mobile app UI.

2. Interactivity (JavaScript):
- Implement the toggle logic to fade one mockup out and the other in using CSS transitions (opacity, transform).
- Default to Web View.

3. Dark Mode Support:
- The entire component must support Tailwind's dark mode (`class="dark"` on html tag).
- Include a specific requirement to use `dark:bg-slate-900`, `dark:text-white`, and `dark:border-slate-800` modifiers for all elements inside the mockups so they look perfect in both themes.
- Include a separate Theme Toggle button (Sun/Moon icon) to test this functionality.

4. Styling Specifics:
- Use `slate` for neutrals, `blue` for primary web accents, and `orange` for mobile accents.
- Use Lucide Icons (via CDN).
- Font: Inter.
- NO external CSS files, use Tailwind utility classes for everything (including shadows and transitions).

OUTPUT:
Provide the complete HTML file including the Head (with Tailwind CDN script and Config) and the Body with the Script tag containing the toggle logic.
