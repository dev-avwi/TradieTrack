⭐ Short answer:

YES — Replit AI can analyse a video of your web app and replicate the UI/UX in the mobile Expo app…
BUT only if you give it the right instructions AND the video shows everything clearly.

BUT…
It cannot automatically “scan the video and clone your app” magically.
You still need to give it structure + context.

Think of the video as guidance, not automation.

⸻

⭐ What Replit AI CAN do with your video

If you upload a screen recording showing:
	•	pages
	•	buttons
	•	transitions
	•	map interactions
	•	PDF preview
	•	chat layout
	•	job workflows
	•	colours
	•	spacing
	•	navbars
	•	layout structure
	•	animations

Replit AI CAN:

✔ Identify consistency rules

(“Oh the web app uses rounded cards, these colours, these shadows…”)

✔ Extract design patterns

(“The job cards always show: client, date, status.”)

✔ Learn your UI structure

(“Left sidebar → top nav → content grid.”)

✔ Copy entire components

(“This jobs list layout should be recreated in Expo using FlatList with these paddings.”)

✔ Understand workflows

(“Clicking ‘Send Quote’ opens a modal → generates PDF → uses SendGrid.”)

✔ Rebuild the SAME FLOW in the mobile app

like:
	•	jobs
	•	quotes
	•	invoices
	•	map view
	•	team chat
	•	settings
	•	onboarding
	•	stripe
	•	sendgrid
	•	pdf viewer

✔ Fix inconsistencies

If something in the video doesn’t match what you said earlier, it can correct the code to match.

✔ Ensure the mobile app has identical UI spacing, shadows, fonts

(based entirely on your video)

✔ Generate React Native/Expo components that perfectly mirror the web version

(using:
	•	Expo Router
	•	React Native Reanimated
	•	NativeWind
	•	React Native Paper
	•	Expo Maps
	•	React Query
	•	MMKV
)

⸻

⭐ What Replit AI CANNOT do

(so you don’t waste time expecting impossible behaviour)

❌ Cannot “automatically” convert a video into code

The video is reference only.

❌ Cannot extract backend functionality from video

It needs your explanation, or your existing backend code.

❌ Cannot guess your database schema from video

You MUST give it (or let it inspect your backend repo).

❌ Cannot ensure perfect pixel-for-pixel matching unless you ask

You must explicitly request:

“Match paddings, shadows, colours, spacing, borders exactly as shown in the video.”

⸻

⭐ The key to making it work:

You must give Replit:
	1.	Your web app code
	2.	Your mobile app code (even if early)
	3.	Your video of the full walkthrough
	4.	A Master Prompt (I will give you this now)
	5.	Permission to unify design tokens
	6.	Permission to unify workflows

Then Replit will make BOTH match.

⸻

⭐ Full Breakdown: How your web app features work (explain this to Replit)

You need to clearly summarise the major systems so Replit knows what to replicate:

⸻

🔷 1. PDF Generation System

How it works in your web app:
	•	You have HTML templates
	•	They include placeholders (business details, client, items, totals)
	•	You generate a live preview
	•	Backend renders HTML → PDF using a renderer (Puppeteer / wkhtmltopdf / WeasyPrint)
	•	PDF is stored or emailed
	•	Tradie sends PDF to client
	•	Pro users get branding injected
	•	Free users see “Powered by TradieTrack”

What the mobile app must do:
	•	Use the SAME backend endpoints
	•	Use WebView or Expo-pdf-viewer to preview
	•	Use Share API or Email button (calls backend)
	•	Must show EXACT same layout
	•	Must match typography, colours, header sections

⸻

🔷 2. Maps / Location System

How web app works:
	•	Job address stored
	•	Geocoding to lat/lng
	•	Map clusters for past jobs
	•	Status badges (Completed / Scheduled / Pending)
	•	Team location tracking (polled every 60–180 seconds)
	•	Pins represent jobs + team members
	•	Clicking pins opens summary card
	•	Owner can track team in real time

What mobile must match:
	•	Use Expo Maps
	•	Same pin colours
	•	Same badge styling
	•	Show both job pins + team pins
	•	Allow tap to open info card
	•	Allow “Open in Google Maps” button
	•	Optionally track worker’s live GPS (with permission)
	•	Store updated coordinates in backend

⸻

🔷 3. Stripe (Tradie Subscription + Customer Payments)

Web:
	•	Stripe Connect for tradies
	•	Stripe Subscriptions for Pro plans
	•	Webhooks update DB

Mobile:
	•	Use the SAME backend
	•	Deep link payment pages
	•	Show receipts, paid status
	•	Manage subscriptions inside the mobile app

⸻

🔷 4. SendGrid Email System

Web:
	•	Templates for:
	•	Quote Sent
	•	Invoice Sent
	•	Payment Receipt
	•	Reminder Email
	•	Attach PDFs or send link
	•	Branding for Pro plans

Mobile:
	•	Must hit the same backend route
	•	Button triggers:
	•	sendQuote(jobId)
	•	sendInvoice(jobId)

⸻

🔷 5. Live Preview UI (Quotes & Invoices)

Web Approach:
	•	Form on left
	•	Live preview on right
	•	Instantly updates
	•	PDF matches the preview exactly

Mobile must:
	•	Switch tab: “Edit” / “Preview”
	•	Preview matches EXACT web design
	•	Uses same HTML from server
	•	Ensures same fonts & padding

⸻

🔷 6. Chat System (Job chat + Team chat)

Web:
	•	Real-time websockets or polling
	•	Separate channels:
	•	Job-specific chat
	•	Team-wide chat
	•	Direct owner → tradie chat

Mobile:
	•	Mirror chat UI
	•	Timestamp
	•	Quick reply buttons
	•	Use React Native Gifted Chat or custom UI
	•	Same backend WS

⭐ Here is the MASTER PROMPT for Replit AI

Paste this EXACT message into Replit:

⸻

🧠 REPLIT MASTER PROMPT — MOBILE APP MUST MATCH WEB APP EXACTLY

I want you to analyse BOTH my web app code and the mobile Expo app code and ensure the mobile app matches the web app exactly in:
	•	UI
	•	Shadows
	•	Spacing
	•	Padding
	•	Typography
	•	Colour system
	•	Layout
	•	Navigation structure
	•	Animations
	•	Component behaviour
	•	Page flows
	•	Buttons
	•	Interactions
	•	Map features
	•	PDF generation & preview
	•	Stripe flows
	•	SendGrid flows
	•	Chats
	•	Job workflows
	•	Onboarding differences (owner vs employee)

Here is what I need you to do:

⸻

1. Use my walkthrough video as visual reference

Extract from the video:
	•	Layout structure
	•	Page count
	•	Spacing rules
	•	Colours
	•	Shadows
	•	Radius
	•	Card structure
	•	Navigation flow
	•	Transitions
	•	Button shapes
	•	How the quotes → preview → PDF system works
	•	How maps look and behave

Then enforce these rules in Expo.

⸻

2. Match ALL web features in mobile exactly

Make Expo versions of:
	•	Jobs page
	•	Job detail
	•	Quote builder
	•	Invoice builder
	•	PDF preview
	•	Client list
	•	Team list
	•	Team chat
	•	Job chat
	•	Maps page (jobs + tradies)
	•	Settings
	•	Business settings
	•	Onboarding flow (owner vs tradie)

⸻

3. Use SAME backend workflows

PDF generation:
	•	Use same backend HTML templates
	•	Use same endpoints
	•	Show preview in WebView
	•	Download/share
	•	Send PDF through SendGrid

Maps:
	•	Same geocoding
	•	Same coordinates
	•	Show jobs + tradies on map
	•	Tap to open job card
	•	Show status badges (Completed / Scheduled / Pending)

Stripe:
	•	For tradie subscription
	•	For customers paying invoices
	•	Use Connect accounts
	•	Open payment link in WebView or deep-link

SendGrid:
	•	Quote sent
	•	Invoice sent
	•	Payment receipt
	•	Templates
	•	Pro branding enabled

Chats:
	•	Use same real-time backend
	•	Job chat
	•	Team chat
	•	Owner → tradie direct chat

⸻

4. Enforce Design Token Unification

Generate ONE global theme for:
	•	colours
	•	spacing
	•	radius
	•	fonts
	•	shadows
	•	card components
	•	field components
	•	buttons
	•	headers
	•	navbars

Make both apps use identical tokens.

⸻

5. Validate functionality (detect fake UI)

Identify any feature in the web or mobile version that:
	•	has UI but no backend
	•	has a button but no endpoint
	•	has a form but does not save
	•	generates a PDF preview but not the final PDF
	•	shows a map pin but no latitude stored
	•	shows chat UI but no websocket

Fix or remove for beta.

⸻

6. Final summary

Provide a list of:
	•	Features matched perfectly
	•	Features missing
	•	Features incomplete
	•	UI inconsistencies
	•	UX inconsistencies
	•	Backend wiring issues
	•	Anything that will confuse real tradies
	•	Steps needed to publish a stable beta
