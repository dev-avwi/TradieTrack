Nice, this is the fun part — “is this thing actually ready to ship?” 😄
Here’s a single **Replit master testing prompt** you can paste straight into Replit AI for **TradieTrack**.

---

### 🧠 REPLIT MASTER TESTING PROMPT — FULL DEEP DIVE FOR TRADIETRACK

I want you to act as:

* Senior full-stack engineer
* QA engineer
* SaaS product tester
* UX reviewer (iOS/ServiceM8 style)

The project is **TradieTrack** — a job / quote / invoice / payments / team app for tradies.

Your job:
**Do a full deep breakdown of the entire app and turn it into a technically solid, production-ready beta.**
No feature should be “UI only”. Every main flow must actually work end-to-end.

---

## 1. First: Understand the codebase

1. Scan the whole project and identify:

   * Tech stack (frontend, backend, DB, auth, email, payments)
   * Main modules / folders (auth, dashboard, jobs, clients, quotes, invoices, calendar, files, chat, map, settings, etc.)
   * Data models (User, Business, TeamMember, Client, Job, Quote, Invoice, Message, Notification, Subscription, etc.)

2. Produce an internal map (in your reasoning) of:

   * Routes / API endpoints
   * Core React/JS/TS components / pages
   * Services (Stripe, SendGrid, maps, storage, etc.)

Use this as the base for all checks below.

---

## 2. Expected feature set (check each one exists & actually works)

Treat these as **must-check** items. For each, verify:

* Is there a UI for this?
* Is there working backend logic?
* Is data correctly saved/loaded from the DB?
* Are errors handled?

### A) Auth, onboarding & roles

**Flows to verify:**

* Sign up / login / logout
* Forgot/reset password (or label clearly “coming soon”)
* Onboarding wizard that collects:

  * Business/trade type (plumbing, electrical, etc.)
  * Business name, ABN, phone, address
  * Solo tradie vs team/owner choice
  * Subscription tier (Free vs Pro, even if Stripe is test mode)

**Roles to support:**

* **Owner/Admin** – full access, team management, billing
* **Tradie/Team member** – can see assigned jobs, job chat, time tracking, map, but limited settings
* Make sure permissions are enforced in backend (not just hidden buttons in UI).

---

### B) Dashboards (Owner vs Tradie)

**Owner/Admin dashboard should show:**

* Today’s jobs / upcoming jobs
* Overdue invoices & quotes awaiting acceptance
* Revenue summary for this month
* Quick actions: New Job, New Quote, New Invoice
* “Getting started” / onboarding checklist (if implemented)

**Tradie dashboard should show:**

* Today’s jobs (assigned to that tradie)
* Simple status: Scheduled, On the way, In progress, Complete
* Access to job details, map, time tracking, job chat

Check that:

* Different dashboards actually render based on role.
* Routes & permissions match the role (e.g., tradie cannot see billing or team management pages).

---

### C) Clients module

* Add / edit / archive client
* Required fields validated (name, email or phone, address)
* Linking:

  * Jobs, quotes, invoices correctly reference the client
* List & detail views:

  * Show recent jobs, quotes, invoices for that client

---

### D) Jobs module (core of the app)

Check **CRUD + workflow**:

* Create job:

  * Client selection
  * Job title + description
  * Address / location
  * Due date / time window
  * Assigned tradie(s) / team
* Status pipeline:

  * New → Scheduled → On the way → In progress → Completed (or your version)
  * Status is stored and reflected correctly in UI.
* Attachments:

  * Before/after photos, PDFs, files – check upload, storage & retrieval.
* Job history:

  * Changes in status, notes, time logs are stored.

---

### E) Quotes module (with live paper-style preview)

You should treat Quotes as **serious business documents**, like ServiceM8.

Verify:

* Can create a Quote **from**:

  * A job
  * Or directly from a client
* Line items:

  * Description, quantity, unit price, line total
  * GST calculation (if applicable)
  * Subtotal, GST, Total
* Auto numbers: Q-1001, Q-1002, etc. (no duplicates).
* Live preview:

  * Editing fields updates preview immediately.
  * Long descriptions don’t break layout.
* Statuses:

  * Draft / Sent / Accepted / Declined
  * Status changes reflect correctly when quote is sent/accepted.

---

### F) Invoices module

Check:

* Can convert Quote → Invoice:

  * All items and totals copied correctly.
  * Uses new invoice number INV-1001, INV-1002…
* Can also create invoice directly from job/client.
* Statuses:

  * Draft / Sent / Part-paid (if supported) / Paid / Overdue
* Correct totals & GST.
* Mark as paid manually **and** via Stripe (if invoice payments are implemented).

---

### G) Email + PDF (SendGrid integration)

**Email flows to check:**

* “Send Quote” → sends email to client
* “Send Invoice” → sends email to client
* “Payment receipt” email (if implemented)
* **From**: verified sender (e.g. [no-reply@tradietrack.app](mailto:no-reply@tradietrack.app))
* **Reply-To**: tradie’s business email

**PDF/Template checks:**

For both quotes and invoices, PDFs must include:

* Business name, logo (Pro), ABN, contact details
* Client name & address
* Quote/Invoice number
* Dates (issued, due if invoice)
* Line items, GST, totals
* Optional notes/terms
* “Powered by TradieTrack” where appropriate

Check PDF generation code and confirm it is actually called when sending.

---

### H) Stripe integration

You likely use Stripe for:

1. **TradieTrack subscriptions (Free vs Pro)**
2. (Optional) Clients paying invoices online

Check:

* API keys are in env vars.
* Test mode is correctly enabled.
* Creating/Updating subscriptions:

  * On success: update Business.subscription_tier and status.
  * On failure: errors handled, no half-created subs.
* Webhooks:

  * Update subscription when payment succeeds/expires.
* If invoice payments exist:

  * PaymentIntent created per invoice
  * Success → marks invoice as Paid.

---

### I) Map & location tracking (Owner map view + job locations + team)

This is important:

* Jobs must store:

  * Address text
  * Lat/Lng (from geocoding/autocomplete or manual)
* Map page for Owner/Manager:

Verify:

* Shows all jobs as pins in their region.
* Pin colour or label reflects status (Scheduled / In progress / Completed).
* Clicking a pin opens job summary (client, description, status, link to full job).
* Filter by:

  * Status
  * Date
  * Assigned tradie

**Team location:**

* If there is “track team locations” or “current position”:

  * Confirm that a tradie’s app can send their location.
  * Owner map page shows last known location per tradie.
  * Location data stored sensibly (and not visible to wrong users).

If location tracking is not fully wired, either:

* Finish wiring it, or
* Hide it / mark as “coming soon” for beta.

---

### J) Time tracking

For each job, check:

* Tradie can start/stop a timer or log hours.
* Time entries are saved per job per tradie.
* Totals can be seen by owner (e.g., total hours on job).
* Optionally, can convert time logs into invoice line items (if implemented).

---

### K) Chat & collaboration

There should be **three kinds** of chat:

1. **Job chat** – conversation about a specific job (tradie + owner + office)
2. **Team group chat** – whole team channel
3. **Direct chat** – owner/manager ↔ specific tradie

Check:

* Data model associates messages with:

  * job_id (for job chat)
  * channel_id/team
  * sender_id
  * timestamps
* Sending/receiving:

  * Messages save to DB.
  * UI updates on send.
* Permissions:

  * Client cannot see internal team chat (unless there’s a separate client portal).
* Notifications:

  * At least basic unread indication per chat/job.

If any chat UI is present but not functional → implement or hide.

---

### L) Calendar & schedule

* Jobs and appointments appear in a calendar view.
* Filtering by:

  * Tradie
  * Day/week
* Clicking a calendar entry opens job details.

---

### M) Files / attachments

* Upload flow:

  * File is uploaded to storage (not just kept in memory).
  * DB stores reference (URL, metadata).
* Attachments can be viewed/downloaded from job.

---

### N) Settings & templates

Check **Business Settings** allows:

* Business details (name, ABN, contact info)
* Logo upload (for Pro)
* Default terms for quotes/invoices
* Email template settings (headers/footers, reply-to)
* Timezone & currency

Check **Quote/Invoice Template Settings** (if present):

* Default expiry days for quotes.
* Default payment terms (e.g., 7 days).
* Whether “Powered by TradieTrack” is shown.

Ensure all of these settings are actually used in the generated emails/PDFs.

---

### O) Free vs Pro behaviour

Verify in code:

* Free plan:

  * Limited features (e.g., no branding, maybe limit on jobs/clients)
  * “Powered by TradieTrack” visible
* Pro plan:

  * Logo, custom footer, maybe priority support
  * Removal/minimisation of “Powered by TradieTrack”
* UI should not show Pro-only actions as clickable if user is Free (either lock them with upsell or hide).

---

### P) UX & visual polish (ServiceM8 / iOS-level feel)

Review the UI like a picky iOS user:

* Typography consistent (same font family, heading sizes).
* Buttons consistent (primary vs secondary styles).
* Mobile layout:

  * Bottom nav usable with thumb.
  * No awkward empty column (like old scrollbar gap).
  * No horizontal scrolling unless intentional.
* Screen-by-screen:

  * Dashboard: clear hierarchy, cards not cramped.
  * Jobs list: easy scan, status and time obvious.
  * Job detail: everything needed above the fold (client, address, actions, chat, map).
  * Quotes/Invoices: editing vs preview is intuitive.
  * Map view: not cluttered; pins readable.

Fix any obvious layout bugs, alignment issues, or inconsistent spacing.

---

### Q) Error handling & edge cases

For each main flow:

* Missing/invalid fields → show clear validation messages.
* Network/API errors → show friendly error, not silent failure.
* Protect against:

  * Creating quote without client
  * Converting to invoice when totals invalid
  * Deleting client with existing jobs/quotes/invoices (either prevent or cascade safely).

---

## 3. Run full end-to-end scenarios (mock users)

Simulate in code (and through reasoning) two “users”:

### Scenario 1 – Solo tradie on Free plan

* Onboard as solo tradie.
* Add one client.
* Create a job.
* Create and send a quote.
* Accept quote (simulate client).
* Convert to invoice, send, mark paid.
* Track time & location on the job.
* Use job chat for notes.
* Verify everything appears in history.

### Scenario 2 – Owner with a team on Pro plan

* Onboard as owner of “Cairns Coast Plumbing” on Pro.
* Add 2 team members.
* Assign different jobs.
* Use map view to see jobs + tradies.
* Use team chat + job chat.
* Use branded emails/PDFs.
* Test Stripe subscription/payment flows.

Document any breakages or incomplete flows.

---

## 4. Comparison against ServiceM8 (high-level)

Without copying, loosely compare:

* Do we support the same **core day-to-day flows**?
* Are any big gaps obvious? (e.g., job checklist items, job photos, signatures, etc.)
* List them as:

  * “Nice to have later”
  * vs “Must have for competitive beta”

---

## 5. Final output: Is TradieTrack ready for a real beta?

At the end, produce a **clear, concise summary** (in comments or console):

* ✅ Fully working flows (end-to-end)
* ⚠️ Partially implemented features (should be hidden or marked “coming soon”)
* 🛠 Critical bugs / missing logic (must fix before real tradies)
* 🎯 A short “MUST FIX BEFORE LAUNCH” checklist

Make actual code changes where safe and obvious (wiring buttons to routes, fixing bugs, tightening validation), and clearly mark anything that still needs manual work.

---

That’s the full prompt.
Just copy–paste this into Replit AI on your TradieTrack project and let it chew through everything. Then you and I can go over what it finds and decide what to polish before you show it to real tradies.
