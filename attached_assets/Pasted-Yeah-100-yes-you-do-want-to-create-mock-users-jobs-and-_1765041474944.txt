Yeah, 100% **yes** — you *do* want to create mock users, jobs, and clients.
Think of it like dress rehearsal before real tradies touch it.

I’ll give you:

1. ✅ What mock accounts/data to use
2. ✅ A **single Replit “Simulate a tradie using my app” master prompt** (including new user creation, owner vs tradie roles, map, time tracking, quotes, invoices, Stripe, email, chat… everything).

You can just **copy–paste the prompt** into Replit AI.

---

## 1️⃣ Mock users & data you should use

Use the same fake people everywhere so flows stay consistent.

### Owner account (business)

* **Role:** Owner
* **Business name:** Cairns Coast Plumbing

* **Phone:** 0400 111 222
* **Address:** 123 Sheridan St, Cairns QLD 4870
* **Plan:** Start on Free → then switch to Pro in tests

### Tradie team member

* **Role:** Tradie / Field worker
* **Name:** Jake Miller

### Jobs (for testing flows)

* **Job 1:** “Fix leaking shower” (Sarah, tomorrow 2:30 pm, Edge Hill)
* **Job 2:** “Install new vanity” (Mark, Friday 10:00 am, Manunda)
* **Job 3:** “Blocked kitchen sink” (Sarah, today 4:00 pm, CBD) – good for “Next job” card.

Use these same names in Replit prompt so it all ties together.

## 2️⃣ Replit MASTER PROMPT – “Simulate a tradie using my app”

Here’s the full thing to paste into Replit AI:

---

**PROMPT TO PASTE INTO REPLIT:**

> I’m building a SaaS web app called **TradieTrack** for tradies (plumbers, sparkies, etc.) to manage:
>
> * jobs
> * clients
> * quotes
> * invoices
> * calendar/schedule
> * team members (owner vs tradie)
> * job chat & team chat
> * time tracking
> * map view with jobs
> * Stripe payments
> * SendGrid emails
>
> I want you to **simulate a real tradie and team using my app**, and verify that:
>
> * all flows are **fully wired**, not “UI only”
> * the **owner** and **tradie** experiences both work
> * the UX is coherent and data flows correctly between pages
>
> Act as:
>
> * a QA engineer
> * a tradie product designer
> * and a slightly picky plumbing business owner
>
> Use the following mock data consistently throughout your reasoning and changes:
>
> ---
>
> ### 1. Mock accounts & data to use
>
> **Owner account (business):**
>
> * Business: “Cairns Coast Plumbing”
> * ABN: 12 345 678 910
> * Email: [cairnscoastplumbing.owner@example.com](mailto:cairnscoastplumbing.owner@example.com)
> * Phone: 0400 111 222
> * Address: 123 Sheridan St, Cairns QLD 4870
> * Plan: start Free, upgrade to Pro part-way through tests
>
> **Tradie team member:**
>
> * Name: Jake Miller
> * Email: [jake.miller@example.com](mailto:jake.miller@example.com)
> * Role: Tradie / Field worker
>
> **Clients:**
>
> 1. Sarah Thompson – [sarah.thompson@example.com](mailto:sarah.thompson@example.com) – 45 Lake St, Cairns QLD
> 2. Mark Evans – [mark.evans@example.com](mailto:mark.evans@example.com) – 28 Hoare St, Manunda QLD
>
> **Jobs:**
>
> * Job 1: “Fix leaking shower” – Sarah – Edge Hill – tomorrow 2:30 pm
> * Job 2: “Install new vanity” – Mark – Manunda – Friday 10:00 am
> * Job 3: “Blocked kitchen sink” – Sarah – today 4:00 pm – CBD
>
> Use these same entities whenever you simulate flows.
>
> ---
>
> ### 2. New user onboarding & roles (owner vs tradie)
>
> 1. Find the **signup/onboarding flow** and confirm:
>
>    * A new owner can sign up and create a **business** (Cairns Coast Plumbing).
>    * Onboarding collects key info: business name, trade type, location, team size, solo vs team.
>    * After onboarding, the **owner dashboard** is different from a tradie dashboard (more controls, settings, billing).
> 2. Confirm there is a way for the owner to:
>
>    * Invite a new user (Jake Miller) as a **Tradie**.
>    * Assign role/permissions correctly.
>    * Ensure the tradie dashboard is simplified (jobs assigned, schedule, map, chat – but no billing/settings).
> 3. If any role-based views are **UI only** (no real role checks), implement or fix:
>
>    * Backend checks on who can see what.
>    * Hiding owner-only pages from tradies.
>
> ---
>
> ### 3. Core daily tradie workflow (simulate real life)
>
> Simulate this exact sequence end-to-end in the code:
>
> **As Owner:**
>
> 1. Create client Sarah.
> 2. Create Job 1 “Fix leaking shower” for Sarah, tomorrow 2:30 pm, in Edge Hill.
> 3. Assign it to tradie Jake.
> 4. Job status: New → Scheduled.
> 5. Ensure job:
>
>    * appears on Jobs list,
>    * appears on Calendar,
>    * appears on Map with correct location.
>
> **As Tradie Jake:**
> 6. Log in as Jake.
> 7. Go to **Today / Activity** view:
>
> * See “Blocked kitchen sink” (Job 3) or nearest job as “next job”.
>
> 8. Open Jobs:
>
>    * See only jobs assigned to Jake.
> 9. Open Job 1:
>
>    * See client, address, notes, attachments, time tracking, chat.
>
> **Do the actual work flow:**
> 10. Start time tracking on Job 1 → work for a while → stop time.
> 11. Add some job notes & maybe photos.
> 12. Mark job status: In Progress → Completed.
>
> **Back as Owner:**
> 13. From Job 1, create a **quote** for Sarah:
> - Labour – 2 hrs @ $110/hr
> - Parts – Mixer tap – $165
> - GST 10%
>
> 14. Confirm:
>
>     * Quote pulls client + job correctly
>     * Totals and GST are correct
>     * Quote number like Q-1001
> 15. Use the **live preview / PDF preview**:
>
>     * Changing line items updates preview
>     * No broken layouts or missing fields
> 16. Click **Send quote**:
>
>     * Ensure this calls a real backend email function (SendGrid), not just a fake UI toast.
>
> ---
>
> ### 4. Email, PDF & quote acceptance flow
>
> Check the SendGrid integration in code:
>
> * “Send quote” uses a real template.
> * From address is a verified sender (e.g. [no-reply@tradietrack.app](mailto:no-reply@tradietrack.app)).
> * Reply-to is the owner’s email ([cairnscoastplumbing.owner@example.com](mailto:cairnscoastplumbing.owner@example.com)).
>
> Ensure the **client experience** is correct:
>
> * Subject line is clear (“Your quote from Cairns Coast Plumbing via TradieTrack”).
> * Email includes either:
>
>   * a link to a public quote page, or
>   * a PDF attachment (or both).
>
> In the backend:
>
> * There is a **public quote view** route.
> * Accepting the quote:
>
>   * updates quote status to Accepted,
>   * stores accepted_at timestamp and accepted_by name/email,
>   * optionally updates job status (e.g. Approved / Ready to schedule).
>
> If quote acceptance exists only in the UI but has no backend route or DB column, implement it or hide it for beta.
>
> ---
>
> ### 5. Convert to invoice & payment (Stripe)
>
> After quote acceptance:
>
> 1. Implement/verify **“Convert to invoice”**:
>
>    * Creates invoice INV-1001.
>    * Copies all items & GST.
>    * Links to same client and job.
> 2. Ensure invoice PDF:
>
>    * shows business name, ABN, contact, client details
>    * shows invoice number, issue date, due date
>    * shows line items, subtotal, GST, total
> 3. “Send invoice”:
>
>    * Calls SendGrid backend function.
>    * Uses proper invoice email template.
>    * Includes either payment link or PDF.
> 4. Stripe:
>
>    * For subscriptions: business pays TradieTrack → Stripe test mode → webhooks update subscription_tier/status.
>    * For invoice payments: client pays tradie:
>
>      * Use Stripe or Stripe Connect (depending on current implementation).
>      * On successful payment, invoice.status = PAID and paid_at timestamp set.
>
> Make sure none of these are dummy buttons: every visible “Send”, “Pay now”, “Mark as paid” must be backed by logic.
>
> ---
>
> ### 6. Map page & location tracking
>
> As Owner, there should be a **Map page** that:
>
> * Shows a map (e.g. Google Maps / Leaflet) centred roughly on Cairns.
> * Plots **job markers** for all active and recent jobs:
>
>   * Job 1 (Edge Hill)
>   * Job 2 (Manunda)
>   * Job 3 (CBD)
>
> For each marker:
>
> * Tooltip or small popup shows:
>
>   * job title
>   * client name
>   * status (New, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed)
>
> Location data:
>
> * Job creation/edit forms save address and, if implemented, lat/lng to the DB.
> * Map uses that stored data, not just a string.
>
> Team locations (if implemented):
>
> * If there is any “View tradies on map / live location” feature:
>
>   * Confirm it calls a real endpoint or uses real stored coordinates.
>   * If not fully implemented, hide or label “Coming soon” for beta.
>
> ---
>
> ### 7. Time tracking & job diary
>
> Confirm that for each job:
>
> * Time entries are stored in the DB (start, end, duration, user).
> * They can be used in invoices (e.g. labour hours).
> * Job diary shows:
>
>   * notes,
>   * time entries,
>   * uploaded files/photos.
>
> Make sure none of these sections are just static placeholders.
>
> ---
>
> ### 8. Chat: job chat + team chat + owner→tradie DMs
>
> Check the messaging system:
>
> * Job chat:
>
>   * Messages are linked to a specific job ID.
>   * Owner and tradies on that job can see/post.
>   * Stored in DB, ordered by timestamp.
> * Team chat / group channels:
>
>   * General team chat for all team members.
> * Direct messages:
>
>   * If there’s an owner → tradie or 1:1 chat UI, ensure:
>
>     * it writes to a real conversation/message model.
>     * it’s filtered properly by participants.
>
> Confirm:
>
> * No “chat” screen is just a mocked list.
> * Sending a message writes to the database and updates UI.
>
> ---
>
> ### 9. Owner vs Tradie dashboards & permissions
>
> Ensure:
>
> * Owner dashboard:
>
>   * Shows KPIs (jobs today, quotes pending, invoices unpaid, map overview).
>   * Can access Settings, Billing, Team, Templates.
> * Tradie dashboard:
>
>   * Focus on today’s jobs, next job, map, time tracking, job chat.
>   * No access to Billing or business-wide settings.
>
> In code:
>
> * Routes/components check role before rendering.
> * Not just hidden in UI, but actually protected.
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔟 UX + “no half-done features” pass
>
> Do a full pass over:
>
> * Nav items
> * Buttons
> * Pages
> * Modals
>
> For beta:
>
> * Any major feature shown in the sidebar/top nav must be **fully implemented**.
> * If something is half-done (just UI, no backend), either:
>
>   * finish it now, or
>   * hide it and mark it as “coming soon” so tradies don’t click dead features.
>
> Also check:
>
> * Loading states (no blank screens).
> * Error messages for failed network calls.
> * No obvious console errors.
>
> ---
>
> ### 11. Final: is this a genuinely usable beta for a real tradie?
>
> At the end, provide (as comments or console.log) a short summary:
>
> 1. ✅ Which flows are now fully working end-to-end:
>
>    * new owner signup
>    * onboarding
>    * invite tradie
>    * create client
>    * create job
>    * schedule job
>    * map view
>    * time tracking
>    * job chat
>    * create quote
>    * send quote (email + PDF/link)
>    * accept quote
>    * convert to invoice
>    * send invoice
>    * Stripe payment
>    * payment receipt
>
> 2. ⚠️ Which features are still prototype/rough and should be labelled “beta” or hidden.
>
> 3. 🛠 Critical MUST-FIX items before inviting 3–10 real tradies.
>
> Use my existing codebase as the source of truth and make whatever improvements are needed so that a real Cairns tradie could genuinely run their day-to-day workflow inside TradieTrack without hitting broken or fake features.

If you run that in Replit AI **and** then you personally do a quick manual Gmail/Stripe test like we discussed earlier, you’ll be in a really good spot to say to your dad (and to real tradies):

> “This isn’t just a school project — it’s a real, working tool a plumbing business could run on.”
