Mobile App Visual Review & Critique
Overall Assessment: 7.5/10
The mobile app is well-structured with good design tokens and theme support, but there are several areas that could be improved for a more polished user experience.

Critical Issues
1. Login Screen - Missing Google OAuth
Web app has Google OAuth, but mobile login only shows email/password
No "Sign in with Google" button visible
Impact: Inconsistent auth experience between platforms
2. Forgot Password Not Implemented
Shows "Password reset functionality coming soon!" alert
This is a core feature that should work before beta launch
3. Tab Bar Missing Visual Polish
The bottom navigation needs clearer active/inactive states
Consider adding haptic feedback on tab switches
UX Improvements Needed
Dashboard (index.tsx)
Issue	Recommendation
Trust Banner takes too much space	Make it collapsible or dismissible after first view
KPI cards lack tap feedback	Add visual press state with scale animation
No skeleton loaders	Add shimmer loading states for data fetch
Activity feed limited to 5 items	Add "View All" button
Jobs Screen
Issue	Recommendation
Search bar not sticky	Pin search to top when scrolling
Status filter chips scroll horizontally	Consider a dropdown for smaller screens
Job cards lack swipe actions	Add swipe-to-complete or swipe-to-call gestures
No pull-to-refresh indicator text	Show "Pull to refresh" hint
Map Screen
Issue	Recommendation
Header card overlaps map content	Make it semi-transparent or collapsible
No clustering for many job pins	Implement marker clustering for dense areas
Missing current location indicator	Add "My Location" button to center on user
Legend not visible	Add a legend explaining status colors
Collect/Payments Screen
Issue	Recommendation
Tap to Pay setup message is unclear	Add step-by-step setup wizard
Amount input field needs formatting	Add thousands separator ($1,234.56)
No receipt preview before charging	Show summary before processing payment
Profile Screen
Issue	Recommendation
Menu items too densely packed	Add section dividers with labels
Avatar is just initials	Allow photo upload from camera/gallery
No role badge visible	Show user's role (Owner/Admin/Staff) prominently
Visual Polish Suggestions
Typography
Page titles are 28px which is good, but subtitles could use more contrast
Consider using Inter font family consistently (currently not specified in all places)
Spacing
Design tokens are well-defined (spacing.md = 8, spacing.lg = 12)
Some screens have inconsistent vertical rhythm between sections
Colors & Theming
Theme system is solid with light/dark support
Status colors are clear but could use more differentiation (icons alongside colors)
Success/Error states could be more prominent
Touch Targets
Most buttons meet 44pt minimum, but some icon buttons are undersized
Filter chips could be taller for easier tapping
Empty States
Many screens have basic empty states
Add illustrations and clearer calls-to-action
Missing Features for ServiceM8 Parity
Swipe gestures on job cards (swipe right to start, swipe left to call)
Voice notes for job descriptions
Photo gallery with before/after views
Digital signatures for job sign-off
Live job timer visible on job card when in progress
Quick job completion from notification
Recommended Priority Improvements
Would you like me to create a task list to fix these issues? I'd suggest prioritizing:

Add Google OAuth to mobile login (auth parity)
Implement forgot password flow (core feature)
Add skeleton loaders across all screens (perceived performance)
Make search bar sticky on Jobs screen (usability)
Add swipe gestures to job cards (ServiceM8 parity)
Implement marker clustering on map (scalability)
Add avatar photo upload (personalization)
Improve empty states with illustrations (polish)
