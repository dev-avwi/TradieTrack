2️⃣ FULL PROMPT FOR REPLIT (COPY-PASTE THIS)

Here’s the big one. This includes everything we’ve talked about: features, roles, onboarding, dashboards, chat, and testing.

PROMPT START

I’m building a SaaS app called TradieTrack for tradies to manage jobs, clients, quotes, invoices, teams, and team communication.

I want you to generate a clean React front-end (React + React Router, TypeScript if possible) with:

Email-based login

Simple multi-step onboarding

Role-based dashboards (owner vs tradie)

Jobs, clients, quotes, invoices, calendar

Job chat + Team chat

Team management

Time tracking

Job checklists

File uploads (mock UI)

GST toggle

Quote Accept/Decline

Map “open in Google Maps”

Activity feed

AI helper placeholders

Basic testing setup

You can use mock data and front-end state only for now. I will hook up Supabase/Firebase later.

1. Auth & Onboarding

Login flow:

Login is email-based, no password.

Step 1: email input + button “Continue with Email”. On submit, call requestLoginCode(email) (mock function).

Step 2: code input (6-digit), button “Verify & Continue”. On submit, call verifyLoginCode(email, code) (mock).

On success:

If isFirstLogin → go to onboarding.

Otherwise → straight to /dashboard.

You can hardcode isFirstLogin as true for now.

Onboarding flow:

Step 1 – Work style

Screen title: “How do you work?”

Two large cards:

“I work on my own” → value solo

“I have a team” → value team

Clicking one saves choice and goes Next.

Step 2A – Solo (if solo)

Title: “Tell us a bit about your business”

Fields:

Business Name

Your Name

Phone Number

Trade Type (dropdown: Plumbing, Electrical, Carpentry, Landscaping, General Handyman, Other)

Button: Continue → call completeOnboarding({ mode: "solo", businessInfo }).

Step 2B – Team (if team)

Title: “Set up your business”

Fields:

Business Name

Your Name

Your Role (Owner / Manager / Admin)

Business Phone Number

Trade Type (same dropdown)

Team Size (radio: 1–3, 4–10, 11+)

Button: Continue → go to Step 3B.

Step 3B – Invite team (optional)

Title: “Invite your team (optional)”
Text: “You can add other tradies or office staff now, or do it later in Settings.”

List of repeatable rows: Name, Email, Role (Tradie / Office / Manager).

Buttons:

“Send invites & Finish”

“Skip for now”

Both call completeOnboarding({ mode: "team", businessInfo, invites }).

For now, completeOnboarding should:

Create a mock currentUser object in context or global state:

{
  id: "user_1",
  name: "John Example",
  email: "john@example.com",
  role: "owner" | "manager" | "tradie",
  business: {
    id: "biz_1",
    name: "Cairns Plumbing Co",
    tradeType: "Plumbing"
  }
}


Navigate to /dashboard.

2. Roles & Layout

Roles:

owner

manager

tradie

Use a currentUser.role field to switch behaviour.

Layout:

Use an AppLayout with:

Left sidebar (desktop) with links:

Dashboard

Team Chat

Settings

Top bar with page title, subtitle, user summary.

On mobile:

Bottom nav with icons: Dashboard, Jobs, Clients, Invoices, More.

In “More”: Calendar, Team Chat, Settings.

Design language:

Primary: #007AFF

Accent: #00C853

Background: #F5F7FA

Cards: white, 10–12px radius, soft shadow.

Typography: modern sans-serif, consistent spacing.

Use simple cards, tables, and clean buttons.

3. Dashboards (Role-Based)

Make a single Dashboard page that renders different sections based on currentUser.role.

Owner/Manager dashboard:

Greeting: “Good morning, {name}” + business name

Stat cards row:

Jobs today (number)

Open jobs

Overdue invoices

“Jobs today” table:

Mock an initial set of messages per job.

No backend or real-time yet; just keep everything in state.

7. Activity Feed

On the Owner/Manager dashboard, show a card:

“Recent activity”

List items like:

“John started Job ‘Leaking shower repair’”

“Invoice INV-102 marked as Paid”

Use mock data, update when user actions happen if easy.

8. AI Helper Placeholders

Add AI buttons:

Job description: “🤖 Rewrite with AI”

Notes: “🤖 Summarise notes”

Quotes: “🤖 Suggest line items”

Invoices: “🤖 Draft invoice email”

Client page: “🤖 Summarise this client”

Dashboard suggestions card: static suggestions

For now, they can just call stub functions that update text with some placeholder content.

9. Maps Integration (basic)

On Job Detail:

Show address in Overview.

“Open in Maps” button that links to:
https://maps.google.com/?q=${encodeURIComponent(address)}

This just opens Google Maps.

10. Testing Setup

Please also:

Set up Vitest + React Testing Library for unit & integration tests.

Set up Playwright for E2E tests.

Add example tests:

Unit tests:

calcInvoiceTotal(items) – adds up line items correctly.

applyGST(amount) – adds 10% correctly.

getStatusLabel(status) – returns the right label.

Integration tests:

<Jobs /> renders a list of jobs from mock data.

<QuoteDetail /> updates status when Accept/Decline is clicked.

E2E tests (Playwright):

create-job.spec – user logs in (mock), creates new job, sees it on Jobs page and Dashboard.

quote-flow.spec – create quote → mark as sent → accept → see linked to job/invoice.

11. Code Structure

Suggested structure:

JobDetail.tsx

Clients.tsx

ClientDetail.tsx

Quotes.tsx

QuoteDetail.tsx

The key is: clean, modern, role-based, with all flows wired as mock front-end so I can connect a backend later.
