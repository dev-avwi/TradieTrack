The collect payments page isn't quite working also Make sure collecting payments is clear and that the payment links when sending that they are composed with a email, also with these notifications and plans it just seems like they are UI I want you to check and yeah with the whole mobile app I need you to go through a big UI check to make sure everything's integrated and actually working and absolutely for everything I need you to do test with set mock data of course to try it all and yeah just make sure everything production ready
Also in activity when you click on a job for some reason it says job not found so let's like make sure all parts are working, make sure the chat hub actually chats cause I still don't understand how the chat hub works like and also there's no create new chat maybe for a team member or set client or something, and yeah just chatting in job doesn't make sense like how do we know the chat is getting sent through to the client in that job and also within the job chat there needs to be details to allow the tradie to know who their talking to of course cause it just doesn't make sense it seems like the chat hub is a 2way in the app where clients have a client portal to use it, but that's not the point of the app, the app is a standalone mobile app and standalone web app just for tradies to use to track things not for client portals and stuff just yet.
Also it still says failed to download pdf maybe it's something to do with mock data who knows, after everything's analysed and criticised and fixed I want to do a big production checking and testing and I want you to do one too for mobile app
Also I was fine with the app settings before I just didn't realise you changed it, so mid way while you were editing it again after it was all goods I realised so I want to let you know
Make sure business templates page works too cause it isn't at the moment
Also the edit button in the top right for both web and mobile app should be changed to a delete button with an are you sure pop thing
Also within job chats and stuff, allow for like uploading of job notes, job photos related to that job, job voice notes and all of the above including items like quotes. Invoices and receipts so that related to a job in the job chat going from tradie to customer they can add photos, videos and anything that relates to the job, make sure this syncs and is allowed to work with the normal messages built in apps on peoples phones, cause isn't that how it's going to work or nah is the chat hub only for twilio cause if so you going to have to add warning and stuff around the app for logically this isn't just for chat
