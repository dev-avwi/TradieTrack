Love this – this is the “does this feel like a real tool tradies can trust every day?” check. 🔧📱

Here’s a single master prompt you can paste into Replit to make it:
	•	Check mobile app vs web app for consistency (UI + features)
	•	Check that everything is trustable, clear, and not just UI-only
	•	Check that the mobile UX feels like TradieTrack, not a different app

Just copy–paste this into Replit AI:

⸻


I’m building a SaaS product called **TradieTrack** for tradies (jobs, quotes, invoices, payments, maps, chat, etc.).

I now have:

- A **web app** version (desktop/mobile web)
- A **mobile app** version

I want you to act as:

- A **QA engineer**
- A **UX reviewer who understands tradies**
- A **consistency checker** between web + mobile

Your goals:

1) Make sure the **mobile app matches the web app** in features and behaviour  
2) Make sure **nothing is UI-only / half-finished**  
3) Make the app feel **trustable, clear and appropriate** for real tradies  
4) Make the **mobile UX feel like the same product as the web app**

Use the existing codebase as the source of truth.

------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ FEATURE PARITY: WEB APP VS MOBILE APP
------------------------------------------------
Compare web and mobile for these core features:

- Auth & onboarding
  - Sign up, login, logout
  - Onboarding questions (solo vs team, trade type, business info)
- Dashboard / Activity screen
- Jobs (list, detail, status updates)
- Clients
- Quotes (create, edit, preview, send)
- Invoices (create/convert, preview, send)
- PDFs (quote + invoice)
- Job chat & team chat
- Files/photos on jobs
- Calendar/schedule
- Map / location features
- Time tracking
- Settings (business, billing, payments, team)
- Stripe flows (subscriptions + invoice payments)
- SendGrid/email flows (quote sent, invoice sent, receipts)

For each of these:

- Confirm the **mobile app actually implements** the same feature as the web app.
- Confirm the **backend calls / API logic** are wired (not just UI screens).
- If mobile is missing something that web has (or vice versa), either:
  - Implement it in mobile too, OR
  - Hide/disable it on mobile for now and mark it clearly as “coming soon” in code comments.

I do NOT want any screens or buttons that look finished but don’t do anything.

------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ TRUST & CLARITY: LANGUAGE + FLOWS
------------------------------------------------
Go through the MOBILE APP UI and check:

- All labels, buttons, and error messages use **simple tradie-friendly language**.
  - Example:
    - “Create job”, “Send quote”, “Mark as paid”, “Complete job”
    - NOT “Submit entity”, “Execute action”, etc.

- Make sure **nothing is confusing or vague**:
  - “Track location” should clearly explain *what* is tracked and *why*.
  - Payment buttons should be clearly labelled:
    - “Take card payment now”
    - “Send payment link”
    - “Record cash/bank transfer”

- Check that key “trust” screens look professional:
  - Quote preview
  - Invoice preview
  - Payment screen
  - Email templates

For each of those, check the text and layout so it looks like something a real business would send, not a test app.

------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ VISUAL CONSISTENCY: MOBILE FEELS LIKE TRADIETRACK
------------------------------------------------
Make the mobile app visually consistent with the web app:

- Same colour palette (blues + orange from the TradieTrack logo)
- Same general typography family (e.g. Manrope/Inter/SF Pro-like)
- Same button shapes (rounded radius) and shadow style
- Same icon style
- Same spacing rules:
  - Padding around cards
  - Spacing between sections
  - Consistent margins

Check:

- Buttons on mobile look like the same brand as web.
- Bottom navigation on mobile uses the same sections as the web app:
  - e.g. Activity / Jobs / Clients / Invoices / More (or whatever the current nav is)
- Card styles and status chips (Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Paid, etc.) use the same colours and shape logic.

If you find any screens that look like a different app (different styling, colours, fonts), refactor them to match the main TradieTrack design system.

------------------------------------------------
4️⃣ SPECIFIC FEATURES TO VERIFY ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED (NOT JUST UI)
------------------------------------------------
Check these carefully on BOTH web and mobile:

A) Job → Quote → Invoice → Payment

- Job creation:
  - Actually writes to DB
  - Status changes (New → Scheduled → In progress → Completed) work in backend AND UI.
- Quote creation:
  - Linked to a real job + client
  - Items, GST, totals calculated
  - Live preview uses the same PDF template logic as web app
- Quote send:
  - “Send quote” button triggers a valid SendGrid email OR queues it correctly
  - Public quote link or PDF view is generated
- Quote acceptance:
  - Acceptance actually updates DB: status = Accepted
  - Acceptance timestamp recorded
  - Optional auto-update of job status

- Invoice creation:
  - Converting quote → invoice copies correct data
  - Invoice numbers are unique and well-formatted
- Invoice send:
  - SendGrid email wired
  - Payment link or PDF working

- Stripe payment:
  - Subscription: tradies paying for TradieTrack
  - Invoice payment: clients paying tradies using Stripe/Stripe Connect
  - Webhooks update invoice to Paid
  - Mobile app reflects payment status changes correctly.

B) PDFs (Quotes & Invoices)

- Confirm mobile uses the same template engine as web, or at least the same layout logic.
- PDFs must include:
  - Business name, ABN, contact
  - Client name + address
  - Quote/Invoice number
  - Dates
  - Items + totals + GST
- Ensure preview in mobile matches final PDF appearance closely enough.

C) Maps & Location

- Job address:
  - Saved in DB (not just shown in UI).
  - If geocoded, lat/lng stored.

- Map page (owner):

  - Shows jobs pinned on a map for their region/city.
  - Pins show job status (e.g. coloured icon or label: Scheduled, In progress, Completed).
  - Cluster behaviour or basic pin handling for many jobs.

- Team/tradie location (if implemented):

  - If you show where tradies are “right now”, make sure any “Track location” features:
    - Actually call a function
    - Send coordinates to backend
    - Don’t fake data.

  - If live tracking is not fully implemented, either:
    - Remove it from mobile beta, or
    - Clearly label as “Coming soon” and do NOT show fake data.

D) Chat (Job & Team)

- Job chat:

  - Messages are stored in the database.
  - Show which user sent each message.
  - Timestamps show correctly in mobile.
  - New message appears without hard refresh.

- Team chat:

  - Group channel exists for the business.
  - Owner/manager can talk to specific tradie (1:1 chat) if that’s in the UI.
  - Same behaviour on web and mobile (no “dead” chat screens on mobile).

E) Roles & Onboarding (Owner vs Tradie)

- Onboarding:

  - Solo tradie vs Team owner vs Team member is captured during onboarding or in settings.
  - That choice affects which dashboard and menu they see.

- Owner dashboard:

  - Sees team overview, more settings, map of jobs, maybe team location, billing, etc.

- Tradie dashboard:

  - Sees MY jobs, MY schedule, job chat, maybe quick actions.
  - Does NOT see owner-only things like billing, global team settings, etc.

- Confirm in code that role-based checks exist (not just hiding things in UI).

------------------------------------------------
5️⃣ MOBILE UX POLISH (iOS/Android FEEL)
------------------------------------------------
On mobile, check:

- All interactive elements are big enough to tap.
- No horizontal scrolling on key screens.
- Bottom navigation is clear, not cluttered.
- Text is readable (no tiny fonts).
- Long job lists + quote lists are scrollable and performant.
- Loading states and error states exist (not just blank screens).

Make mobile feel like a first-class experience, not a cut-down version.

------------------------------------------------
6️⃣ “NO HALF-DONE FEATURES” PASS
------------------------------------------------
Do a final pass through:

- All navigation items
- All main buttons
- All visible sections

For each:

- If there is UI, there must be working logic behind it.
- If there is no time to implement logic, then:

  - hide the feature for now in beta, OR
  - clearly label it as “Coming soon” in UI and keep it out of primary flows.

I do NOT want users to see a button, tap it, and nothing real happens.

------------------------------------------------
7️⃣ FINAL SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------
At the end, produce a summary (in comments or console) with:

- ✅ List of flows that are now fully working on **both web and mobile**
- ⚠️ List of features that are **web-only or mobile-only** and why
- 🛠 Critical issues you found and fixed (UI-only parts, broken flows, missing backend wiring)
- 🎯 Your judgement: Is TradieTrack now a **trustable, clear, technically solid beta** for real tradies on BOTH web and mobile?

Please go through the codebase carefully, fix or hide incomplete things, and ensure web + mobile feel like ONE consistent, professional product that tradies can trust every day.

You can:
	1.	Paste that into Replit AI.
	2.	Let it refactor, wire missing things, and hide any fake/half-done bits.
	3.	Then do your own manual test on your phone (login as owner + as tradie) and just feel:
	•	Does this make sense?
	•	Would a real tradie know what to do next on every screen?

If you want, next I can write you a simple real-world “owner vs tradie” test script you can follow on your phone step-by-step.
