Gotcha, this is the perfect time to tighten the visual side as well as the “business logic” stuff.

I’ll do two things for you in this message:

Explain what’s probably causing that weird blank column + general layout issues in simple terms

Give you a Replit “UI & Layout Deep Audit” prompt that tells it to:

find the column bug

clean up all page layouts

make the 2×2 widget layout work properly

keep everything consistent and easy for tradies

You can paste this new prompt in addition to the quotes/invoices one.

1️⃣ What’s likely causing the blank column + “left-centered” look

Based on what you described earlier and the screenshots:

Some pages (Dashboard, Jobs, etc.)
→ have a big unused column on the right

One page (“More”)
→ looks normal and uses the full width

That nearly always means:

✅ A layout/container is reserving space for something that’s no longer there.

Common culprits:

A leftover CSS grid with 2 columns
Something like:

.app-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 280px 1fr;
}


or

grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;


but on some pages, the second column is basically empty.

A flex layout with a “ghost” sidebar area
e.g. display: flex; with two children, but one is now hidden with display:none on the inside, not actually removed from the layout.

A page-level wrapper that has a fixed width and sticks to the left
e.g.:

.page {
  max-width: 900px;
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-right: auto;
}


So instead of being centered, it hugs the left, leaving “blank” right space.

Different container on the More page
The More page might be using:

a different layout component

or a more correct max-width + margin: 0 auto

or no extra wrapper at all.

So the bug is not “the page is broken” – it’s:

One or more layout components (grids/wrappers) are still using a two-column structure or left-aligned container that doesn’t match your new “single-column / centered content” design.

Replit needs to:

compare the layout used by the “good” More page

to the layout on all other pages

and standardise them.

2️⃣ How your 2×2 widget layout should work (so it doesn’t feel cramped or weird)

You said you’re using a 2×2 widget layout to avoid super long pages.

That’s a great idea. The right way to do that is:

Use a CSS grid for the main “widget area”

On desktop: 2 columns

On tablet/mobile: collapse to 1 column

Example pattern:

.widgets-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .widgets-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}


And wrap your cards (dashboard tiles, small panels, etc.) inside that grid – not the whole page.

The outer shell of the page should be something like:

<AppLayout>
  <PageHeader title="Dashboard" />
  <PageContent>
    <div className="widgets-grid">
      {/* Card 1 */}
      {/* Card 2 */}
      {/* Card 3 */}
      {/* Card 4 */}
    </div>
  </PageContent>
</AppLayout>


Where:

<AppLayout> handles the sidebar/topbar + general width

<PageContent> ensures the page is centered and not left-hugged

.widgets-grid only arranges the inner cards.

Right now, you probably have some mix of:

layout grid + widgets grid

or page using a 2-column grid at the top level instead of just for cards.

That’s what we’re going to tell Replit to untangle.

3️⃣ Page-by-page quick UX sanity check (what Replit should look at)

Here’s what I’d want Replit to audit on every page:

Dashboard

Uses the same main layout as other pages

Has a visible title (“Dashboard”)

Main content inside:

2×2 grid of widgets (for stats, jobs today, etc.) on desktop

1 column on mobile

No weird right-hand whitespace

Jobs list

Table/list fills available width (within your max-width)

Filters easy to see at top

Not squeezed into a tiny left column

Job detail

Content centered in the main column

Tabs or sections stacked clearly

No “micro column” squeezed because of grid leftovers

Clients, Quotes, Invoices

Same general layout: page header, actions, table/sections below

No different container that creates that left-hug issue

Calendar

Month/week view should be centered or reasonably sized

Chat

Chat column fills available space

Input stays visible at bottom

Settings / More

This page already looks “right” → use it as the pattern/layout reference.

Replit’s job: make every page follow the same layout structure as the one that already works (More/Settings).

4️⃣ Replit “UI & Layout Deep Audit” prompt

Here’s the exact prompt you can paste into Replit to get it to analyse and fix UI/layout (including the empty column bug and 2×2 layout).

🧠 PROMPT FOR REPLIT — UI & LAYOUT DEEP AUDIT

I’m building a SaaS app called TradieTrack. The backend and core logic are mostly working; now I need you to do a deep audit and clean-up of the UI and layout.

There are two main things I need:

Fix a layout bug:

On most pages, there’s a big unused column of space on the right, and the content looks left-centered.

On the “More” page, the layout looks correct.
I want you to find why this is happening and standardise the layout so all pages look consistent and clean.

Improve the overall UI structure, especially the 2×2 widget layout on the dashboard and other page layouts, so the app feels modern and easy for tradies.

Please follow these instructions.

1) Find and fix the “unused right column” issue

Go through the layout components (for example: App, AppLayout, Layout, Shell, Sidebar, Main, etc.) and:

Identify any:

display: grid with multiple columns (like grid-template-columns: ...)

display: flex layouts with two children where one is acting as a “ghost” sidebar

fixed max-width containers that are left-aligned (margin-right: auto; margin-left: 0)

wrappers that exist on some pages but not on the “More” page.

Then:

Compare the layout structure used on the “More” page to other pages (Dashboard, Jobs, Clients, Quotes, Invoices, Calendar, Chat, etc.).

Make sure all pages share a single, consistent main layout pattern, like:

<AppLayout>
  <Sidebar />
  <div className="main-area">
    <TopBar />
    <main className="page-container">
      {/* page content here */}
    </main>
  </div>
</AppLayout>


Ensure .page-container:

uses max-width and margin: 0 auto for centering, or

uses full-width flex but doesn’t leave arbitrary right-side blank column.

Remove or refactor any old grid/flex structure that reserved space for a sidebar or extra column that no longer exists.

Goal: No page should have a random empty column. Content should appear either centered (with a reasonable max width) or full-width in a single main content area.

2) Standardise the page layout across all screens

Every main page (Dashboard, Jobs list, Job detail, Clients, Quotes, Invoices, Calendar, Chat, Settings, More) should:

Use the same top-level layout component(s).

Have:

a clear <PageHeader> with a title (and optional subtitle/actions)

a <PageBody> or .page-container where all content lives

Respect consistent padding and spacing.

Please:

Identify any pages that use a different wrapper or completely different layout style.

Convert them to use a unified layout pattern (e.g. <AppLayout> + .page-container).

Remove duplicated layout logic that is re-implemented per-page.

3) Fix and improve the 2×2 widget layout

On the dashboard (and any similar widget pages), I want a 2×2 card layout on desktop, collapsing to a single column on mobile.

Implement a dedicated component or class for this, e.g.:

<div className="widgets-grid">
  { /* cards here */ }
</div>


with CSS like:

.widgets-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));
  gap: 16px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .widgets-grid {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}


Make sure:

Only the cards are in this grid, not the entire page layout.

The page itself still uses the standard page-container so we don’t accidentally reintroduce the “extra column” issue.

On mobile, cards stack nicely and do not force horizontal scrolling.

4) Page-by-page layout review

For each page, do a quick audit and clean-up:

Dashboard:

Use PageHeader (“Dashboard”) and widgets-grid for your main 2×2 cards (e.g. stats, jobs today, activity, etc.).

Ensure no extra unused column exists.

Make sure it looks good on both desktop and mobile.

Jobs List:

Table/list should use the full width of .page-container.

Filters at the top should be clearly aligned.

No random narrow column on the left or extra blank space on the right beyond the main layout.

Job Detail:

The content should sit in a single main column.

Tabs or sections (Overview, Photos, Files, Notes, Checklists, Time, Job Chat) should be clearly laid out.

No squeezed left column caused by grid leftovers.

Clients / Quotes / Invoices:

Each should follow the same pattern:

Page header with title + main action button

Filters/search (if any)

Table or content area

Ensure they’re using the same .page-container rules as Dashboard/More.

Calendar:

The calendar component should be centered or aligned nicely within .page-container.

No extra layout wrappers that break the general layout model.

Chat (Team + Job):

The chat pane should expand to fill available width within .page-container.

Message list should scroll correctly.

Input bar should be fixed to the bottom of the chat container.

Settings / More:

Use the same PageHeader and .page-container.

If this page already looks correct, use it as the “reference layout” for all other pages.

5) Design consistency & spacing

After fixing the structural layout:

Ensure consistent:

page paddings (top, sides, bottom)

card spacing (gap between widgets)

heading sizes

body text sizes

button styles

Remove layout hacks:

inline style overrides for height/width that cause odd spacing

random margin-left/margin-right tweaks to “fake” alignment

Make sure the app looks good and readable on:

Desktop (full HD)

Tablet widths

Mobile (e.g. ~375px)

6) Avoid regressing the “More” page

If the More page is already visually correct:

Treat its layout structure as the correct pattern.

Make other pages match its underlying container logic, not the other way around.

7) When done, explain the changes

When you’re finished with the layout clean-up:

Summarise:

what the root cause of the extra right-hand column was

which components you updated

how the new layout structure works (e.g. AppLayout + main-area + page-container)

how the 2×2 widget grid is implemented

Call out any pages that still need design polish vs structural fixes.

Use this as the source of truth for improving the UI so that:

there’s no random blank column,

all pages feel consistent,

the dashboard uses a proper 2×2 layout,

and the whole app feels simple and cle
