Do all these but make sure their integrated and implemented perfectly on both web and mobile and that they work seamlessly2. Quick Actions from Dashboard
"Log today's hours" button for time tracking
"Photo a receipt" for expense tracking
"Request payment" one-tap from unpaid invoices card
3. SMS Quote/Invoice Delivery
Many clients (especially homeowners) respond faster to SMS than email
"Send via SMS" option alongside email when sending quotes/invoices
Twilio is already integrated - just needs UI
4. Voice Notes on Jobs
Let tradies record voice memos instead of typing job notes
Hands are often dirty/busy on site
Transcribe with AI for searchable notes
Also With the voice note part I like how it is now it's good but after voice recording I'll be good like ai analysis of photos where we can transcribe the audio recording and it has the option to edit the words and upload to the notes section like ai photo analysis.
I want this but I don't know how to make it professional and clean1. First-Time User Video Walkthrough
Add a 60-second intro video on first login showing how to create their first job, quote, and invoice
Tradies often learn by seeing, not reading
Could reduce support questions significantly
Let's try this and see what it'll be and also for all changes make sure their mock data can integrate with it and the production ready to ensure nice testing6. Recurring Job Templates
"Repeat this job weekly/monthly" for maintenance contracts
Pool cleaning, lawn care, HVAC servicing are common use cases
Auto-creates jobs and reminders
8. I thou g to we had this like an on my way or quick actions if it says overdue the job or late, the quick action will change to "Running Late" One-Tap
When tradie is delayed, one tap sends SMS to client
Pre-written message: "Running 15 mins late, see you soon!"
Nice-to-Have Improvements
9. Before/After Photo Comparison
Side-by-side before/after shots for completed jobs
Great for social proof and client satisfaction
Easy to share on social media
10. Simple CRM / Lead Pipeline
Track enquiries before they become quotes
"Enquiry → Quote Sent → Follow-up → Won/Lost"
Basic pipeline view
12. End-of-Day Summary Email
Daily digest: "3 jobs completed, $2,450 invoiced, 1 quote accepted"
Keeps business owners informed
Optional weekly summary
