So: visually, you’ve built a card-based, mobile-first SaaS UI with:

Rounded cards, lots of white space, soft shadows.

Accent color (blue or red) that drives selected states, CTAs, FAB, bottom-tab highlight.

Consistent layout: header → filters/search → stats cards → lists → FAB.

Prompt for Replit: “TradieTrack UI/UX Design + Implementation”

Here’s a prompt you can paste into Replit so the agent knows exactly how to treat the UI for both web + mobile:

You are the lead UI/UX + front-end engineer for a job-management app called TradieTrack.

Goal: Maintain and refine a unified design system across the web app (desktop/tablet) and the mobile app (Expo React Native), based on these principles:

Navigation

Mobile: keep a 4-tab bottom nav: Dashboard, Jobs, Map, More with pill-style highlight and a floating sparkle “+” action button in the bottom-right.

Web: a top header bar with logo + “TradieTrack” text, search, theme toggle, notifications, and user avatar. Hamburger icon opens a side drawer with: Dashboard, Jobs, Clients, Quotes, Invoices, Calendar, Time Tracking, Templates, Map, Reports, Account switcher, Logout.

All screens must work in light and dark mode, using a single theme object.

Visual style

Card-based layout with generous spacing, 12–16px border radius, soft shadows, and clean, system-native fonts.

Accent colour comes from a Brand → App Color setting (blue/red/green etc). Use it consistently for:

Primary buttons

Selected tabs/chips

Icon highlights

FAB background

Light mode: white cards on #F5F5F5 style background.
Dark mode: deep navy/charcoal backgrounds with subtle gradients and high-contrast text.

Key screens to preserve

Dashboard: hero “TradieTrack – Free During Beta” card (with badges for GST compliant, Secure payments, Encrypted) + quick stats tiles (Jobs Today, Overdue, Quotes Pending, Revenue).

Jobs: filters (chips for All/New/Scheduled/In Progress/Completed/Invoiced), stat tiles, job cards, and a job-details view with the Photos section (“Take or Upload Photo”) and “See Suggested Actions” panel.

What’s Next panel: vertical list of suggested actions (Create Invoice, Email Invoice, SMS Payment Link, etc.) with toggles, descriptions, “Preview what will happen”, and a CTA button “Run X Actions”.

Quotes & Invoices: list views with filter chips and stat tiles; detail pages with business header, meta section (Quote #/Invoice #, dates, status), items table (Description, Qty, Unit Price, Total), totals section, and top actions (Print, Save as PDF).

Clients: searchable list, chips for With Email/Phone/Address, and stat tiles.
- Map: dark map view with Job Map card and filters (job type, legend, refresh).

AI Assistant: bottom sheet called “TradieTrack AI – Your smart business mate” with quick-action buttons and a text input.

Settings: Subscription screen (Free Plan vs Pro features) and Brand → App Color palette.

Behaviour

All cards, filters, and lists should feel native-mobile: smooth scrolling, clear tap targets, no cramped rows.

Whenever a new feature is added (e.g. team management, job photos, Stripe terminal, AI prompts), it must:

Plug into this design system (colors, spacing, typography).

Use existing patterns (cards, chips, bottom sheet, detail layout) instead of inventing new ones.

Keep accessibility in mind: minimum 4.5:1 contrast for text, large hit areas, and readable font sizes.

When you edit any UI code, preserve this structure and polish: don’t introduce inconsistent colors, border radii, or typography. If you need a new component, build it on top of the shared design system (buttons, cards, chips, list items) so web and mobile stay visually aligned.

3. Replit Master QA Prompt for TradieTrack

This is the one you asked for explicitly: “Generate the Replit Master QA Prompt for TradieTrack.”
Copy-paste this into Replit so the agent can systematically test everything:

Role: You are a senior QA engineer testing TradieTrack, a job/quote/invoice management system for tradies. There is a web app and a mobile app (Expo React Native) talking to the same backend.

Overall goal: Simulate real tradies using the product end-to-end. Attempt to break things, find confusing flows, and verify that the UI, API calls and data stay in sync.

Test data setup

Create a new business account (if possible) called “Harris Electrical Test”.

Create test clients with realistic Australian details (names, emails, phone numbers, addresses around Cairns).

Create ~10 jobs with a mix of statuses:

New, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Invoiced.

Include different locations so the Job Map has multiple pins.

Create 3–5 quotes and convert some of them into invoices.

Web app QA (desktop browser)

Go through every major area using the sidebar + tabs:

Dashboard

Check stats match actual data (jobs today, overdue, quotes pending, revenue).

Toggle dark/light mode and confirm UI updates correctly.

Open the AI assistant and trigger quick actions (“What needs my attention today?”, “Help me chase up overdue payments”) and verify responses make sense.

Clients

Create, edit, and delete a client.

Test searching by name, email, phone, and address.

Verify the summary tiles (Total Clients, With Email, With Phone, With Address) update correctly.

Jobs

Create a new job, assign client + address, schedule date/time.

Use chips (All/New/Scheduled/In Progress/Completed/Invoiced) and confirm counts + filters.

Open a job:

Upload at least one photo.

Use “See Suggested Actions” → create a quote and/or invoice via the “Run X Actions” flow.

Confirm jobs, quotes, and invoices stay linked.

Quotes

Verify counts and filters (All/Draft/Sent/Accepted/Rejected).

Open a quote, edit line items, save, print, and save as PDF.

Send via email (using the Gmail integration if configured) and confirm the email content.

Invoices

Use the “New Invoice” screen:

Select a client, set dates, add line items.

Switch between Edit and Preview modes and verify the preview updates live.

Mark an invoice as paid (if supported) and confirm revenue on Dashboard updates.

Map

Open Job Map and check that all jobs appear as pins in the correct locations.

Use filters (job type, legend, refresh) and confirm they behave correctly.

Settings / More

Subscription page: confirm Free vs Pro features are labelled correctly.

Brand → App color: change accent colors and confirm it updates buttons, chips, and FAB.

Email via Gmail: trigger a quote/invoice send and confirm Gmail opens with correct template.

Mobile app QA (Expo/EAS build on iOS)

Using the installed iOS build:

Log in with the same account used on web.

Verify Dashboard, Jobs, Map, More tabs match the web in data and layout (within mobile constraints).

For Jobs:

Start from Dashboard -> open a job -> add photos using the phone camera + gallery.

Use “See Suggested Actions” → create quote/invoice from mobile and then confirm on web.

For Quotes & Invoices:

Ensure lists, filters, detail views and totals match the web.

Confirm that creating/editing here is reflected in web almost instantly (or after refresh).

Job Map on mobile:

Allow location permissions.

Confirm your current location appears where expected and that job pins are visible.

Notifications:

If push notifications are configured, trigger whatever events are available (e.g. new job, overdue invoice) and verify iOS receives and opens the correct screen.

Team management & roles

Create a team with at least 3 members:

Owner (Admin)

Field Tech

Office Staff

For each role:

Confirm what they can see (jobs, clients, quotes, invoices, map).

Confirm what they can do (create/edit/send, mark complete, dispatch, etc.).

Ensure that:

Dispatching a job to a tech updates both the Job list and Map for that user.

Permissions are enforced (e.g. techs can’t modify Stripe settings or global brand colors).

Payments (Stripe / Tap to Pay)

On web, open an invoice and attempt a payment using any available Stripe test mode (or at least hit the “Collect Payment” flows).

On mobile, test any Tap-to-Pay or NFC-related flows and verify errors are handled (your logs showed 500s for terminal-connection-token—ensure the UI surfaces those errors nicely).

Reporting

Use the Reports section if available: run each report, export if possible, and compare numbers to invoices/jobs.

Output

Produce a structured QA report:

Passed / Failed / Not Implemented per feature.

Steps to reproduce any bugs.

Screens where UI/UX is inconsistent with the design system.

Suggestions where a tradie might be confused in real life.

4. Do you need a trademark?

Short version:

No, you don’t have to register a trademark to ship the app.

Yes, it’s a good idea long-term if:

You plan to grow this into a real business.

You don’t want someone else to use the same/similar name in Australia.

What actually matters right now:

Make sure nobody obvious is already using “TradieTrack” for a similar app (quick IP Australia / Google / App Store search).

When you’re closer to public launch and paying customers, talk to a real IP/trade-mark lawyer or use an Australian trade-mark filing service to register the name + logo.

(That’s high-level info only – not legal advice.)

5. Will tradies actually switch? Is it useful enough?

From your screenshots + features, real value props:

All-in-one: Jobs, quotes, invoices, map, clients, calendar, time tracking.

Aussie-specific: GST, “Friendly Australian-style email”, AU addresses, etc.

AI sidekick: “Your smart business mate” that drafts emails, chases payments, surfaces what needs attention.

Gmail built-in: No weird SMTP setup. Tradie just uses their Gmail.

Stripe + Tap-to-Pay: On-site card payments with iPhone.

Clean, modern UI: Much less clunky than ServiceM8/Tradify visually.

This is absolutely useful enough to test with real tradies.

Where you still need proof:

How fast is it in the field with bad reception?

Is the job workflow (new job → schedule → onsite → photos → complete → invoice → payment) smoother than ServiceM8/Tradify for their exact trade?

Does AI actually save time, or just look cool?

That’s what your beta tests should answer.

6. How to create Bevel-style 3D promo mockups

That Bevel ad is basically:

A 3D iPhone mockup,

Dropped onto a dark gradient background,

With labels pointing at different features.

You can recreate that with:

Figma + a “device mockup” plugin (shots.so, Mockuuups Studio plugin)

or Canva with “smart mockups” (search “phone mockup” templates)

or tools like Rotato / Artboard Studio if you want proper 3D.

Basic steps:

Screenshot your best screen (e.g. dark-mode dashboard or Job Map).

Drop it into a device mockup (iPhone 15 Pro frame).

Put that on a dark gradient background.

Add short feature callouts with arrows/lines (e.g. “Job Map”, “AI Business Mate”, “Tap to Pay”, “Quotes & Invoices”).

Export as vertical 9:16 for TikTok/Reels and you’ve got something very close to that Bevel ad.
