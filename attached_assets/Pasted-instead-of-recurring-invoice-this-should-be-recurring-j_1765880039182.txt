instead of recurring invoice this should be recurring job somewhere in job journey, so if theres another thing the client asked for then you can duplicate the job and yeah go from there and edit it you know, that would be great.
also the upload of photos/videos isnt working and also i want you to give another comprehensive rating and comparison with serivce m8 and like make sure it really is good to go, so do lots of those E2E tests so i know the workflow is perfect, so i think create a new test account and like gmail, and make sure that when creating a new accoutn, a welcome email is actually sent, or you can use my admin@avwebinnovation.com, then create a job, or link with xero so i want all clients, quotes, invoices thats already with xero for the tradie, to link to tradietrack, then tradietrack can edit those things, and once edited or something, it syns with xero and the web app, also then create a job, make sure to put everything in, test all features, take the clients signature, make sure when its a first time as a worker with job, add the option to create your own signature, cause this is only seen in settings, adn that'll be very good so that once done once, its underneath or next to the option of oclient and fills in with every job worker is assigned to or the owner whoever, done the job that signautre is there on the invoice at the end along with client, then make a quote, make sure it actually sends, then that quote gets sent back, or should the client sign the quote on the email somehow, then that gets filled in on the job automatically next to worker signature, cause maybe client wont be home, so they can sign on quote if they are not going to be home, then this automatically fills in, in job journey just like how worker/tradie does, then this gets filled in on invoice, adn yeah after that, check the payment link generation within the invoice, or after it, in the email, i forgot how we're going to do it, so remind me, wait also we got to add collect payment within the job journey as an option after job is complete, so this cancels out the paymnent link egneration after creating invoice, so just make sure everything is logical and makes sense and yeha make sure everything goes to plan/
