Here it is — the official “TradieTrack UX Checklist” you can use for every single screen you design or build.

This is the EXACT kind of checklist pro SaaS teams use to keep the entire app feeling fast, clean, consistent, and built for tradies.

This is your design bible from now on.
Copy it → Paste it into Replit → Use it for every screen you build.

🔧 TRADIETRACK UX CHECKLIST (FOR EVERY SCREEN)
Follow this EXACTLY. If a screen breaks even one rule, fix it.
1️⃣ CLARITY CHECK

Every screen must answer these 3 questions in under 1 second:

1. What is this screen?

✔ Clear title (Jobs, Quote #1012, Dashboard, Photos)
✔ No ambiguous names
✔ Breadcrumbs or back button always visible

2. What can I do here?

✔ Actions must be obvious (Add Job, Add Photo, Send Invoice)
✔ Avoid hidden actions or long menus
✔ Only 1–3 primary actions per screen

3. What should I do NEXT?

✔ Highlighted primary button (“Create Quote”, “Mark Job Complete”)
✔ Progress indicators (Quote → Job → Invoice)

If a tradie hesitates or looks confused → UI failed.

2️⃣ TAP COUNT RULES
Absolute rule: no common task should take more than 5 taps.
MUST meet these:

✔ Create a job → ≤ 3 taps
✔ Add photos → 1 tap
✔ Send invoice → ≤ 3 taps
✔ Mark job complete → 1–2 taps
✔ Assign job → ≤ 3 taps

If any workflow takes too long → redesign.

3️⃣ ONE-HAND USABILITY

Tradies often use the app:

in a van

on ladders

holding tools

while wearing gloves

with dirty hands

Therefore:

✔ Buttons must be large
✔ Primary actions at the bottom (thumb zone)
✔ No tiny icons
✔ No text smaller than 14–15px
✔ Actions reachable with thumb only

If a tradie can't operate it with one hand → fail.

4️⃣ SPEED & PERFORMANCE CHECK

Every screen must load:

⏱ Under 1 second (goal)
⏱ Under 2 seconds (absolute max)

Checklist:
✔ Skeleton loaders (never show blank white screens)
✔ Preload common data (jobs, clients)
✔ Do NOT fetch 10,000 records at once
✔ Use infinite scroll or pagination

Tradify feels slow; ServiceM8 can lag.
Speed is your weapon.

5️⃣ VISUAL HIERARCHY

Your screens must have a clear visual “flow.”

Rules:

✔ Big title at top
✔ Primary action = bold coloured button
✔ Secondary = outlined or grey
✔ Group related items into cards
✔ Important info = top; details = bottom
✔ Avoid clutter & dense data

6️⃣ REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD

Tradies don’t want to THINK — they want to DO.

Therefore:

✔ No more than 6–8 elements per screen
✔ Avoid long forms
✔ Use defaults wherever possible
✔ Auto-fill data when possible
✔ Turn complex tasks into guided steps
✔ Use icons AND labels (not icons alone)

Make everything “obvious at a glance.”

7️⃣ CONFIRMATION & FEEDBACK

Tradies need reassurance the app WORKED.

EVERY action MUST show feedback:

✔ “Saved ✓”
✔ “Quote sent ✓”
✔ “Invoice paid 💰”
✔ “Photo uploaded ✓”

Micro-feedback builds trust.

8️⃣ ERROR-PROOFING

Prevent mistakes BEFORE they happen.

✔ Auto-save everything
✔ Warn if leaving unsaved screen
✔ Prevent duplicate jobs
✔ Validate fields instantly (“Invalid email”)
✔ Background syncing so users never lose data
✔ Must work offline, with auto sync later

9️⃣ DESIGN LANGUAGE

Ensure consistency across all screens.

Colours:

Primary = brand colour

Secondary = neutral

Error = red

Success = green

Info = blue

Spacing:

Use uniform margins (8, 12, 16, 24 px grid)

Components:

Use the SAME:

buttons

cards

lists

form fields

headings

Consistency = professionalism.

🔟 AI INTERACTION CHECK

If the screen uses AI:

Must follow:

✔ AI results ALWAYS editable
✔ Show a “thinking” animation, not loading spinner
✔ Suggest 2–3 alternate outputs
✔ Use simple tradie language, not corporate language
✔ Allow “Regenerate”
✔ AI should not replace user control — only speed things up

If AI makes tradie type MORE → fail.

1️⃣1️⃣ OFFLINE-FIRST CHECK

Every screen must:
✔ Save offline instantly
✔ Show offline status
✔ Sync cleanly when back online
✔ NEVER lose data

Test:
Put phone in airplane mode.
Add job, photos, notes.
Turn off airplane mode.
All should sync automatically.

This alone beats 80% of competitor apps.

1️⃣2️⃣ ACCESSIBILITY & ENVIRONMENT CHECK

Tradies use the app in harsh conditions:

sunlight

dust

glare

on roofs

in rain

Therefore:
✔ High contrast mode
✔ Large tap areas
✔ Avoid light grey text
✔ Support dark mode
✔ Vibrations on send/complete
✔ Buttons usable with wet/dirty hands

1️⃣3️⃣ SECURITY CHECK

Every screen handling user data must:
✔ Auto-lock after X minutes
✔ Hide sensitive data in multitask preview
✔ Enforce secure API calls
✔ Validate input
✔ Protect payments & invoices

1️⃣4️⃣ PREDICTABILITY RULE

Every user action should do EXACTLY what they expect.

If a button surprises the user → fail.

Examples:

Save should SAVE

Send should SEND

Back should go back, not delete

No weird behaviour. No hidden surprises.

🎯 FINAL VERSION — "THE 6-SECOND TEST"

After building any screen, ask:

If a tradie opened this screen for the first time, could he:

Understand what he’s looking at

Know what to do next

Complete the task in under 6 seconds

If the answer is not YES → the screen is not ready.
