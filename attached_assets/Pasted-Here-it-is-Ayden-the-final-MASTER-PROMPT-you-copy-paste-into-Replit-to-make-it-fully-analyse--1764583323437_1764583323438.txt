Here it is, Ayden — the **final MASTER PROMPT** you copy-paste into Replit to make it fully analyse *every single part* of your app and confirm it is **production-ready**, **beta-ready**, **feature-complete**, and free of “UI-only” or incomplete logic.

This is the *highest-level professional QA prompt* you will ever need.

Copy **everything** below exactly:

---

# ⭐ **TRADIETRACK – REPLIT MASTER PRODUCTION/BETA TESTING PROMPT**

*(Copy + paste directly into Replit AI)*

---

**You are the QA Engineer, UX Auditor, and Senior Full-Stack Reviewer for the TradieTrack app.
Your job is to thoroughly inspect the entire codebase, backend logic, UI/UX, integrations, and workflows to determine if the app is fully production/beta-ready.
Do not assume anything — inspect all parts of the code and provide specific fixes, improvements, checks, and missing logic.**

* Rate limiting & API error resilience
* Mobile responsiveness
* Offline mode support
* Cloud database sync

Mark each one as:
✔ Done
⚠ Needs Improvement
❌ Missing

And explain WHY.

5. Quote numbering (`QT-1001`, `QT-1002`, etc.)
6. PDF generation quality
7. Email sending (SendGrid)
8. Customer acceptance link
9. Acceptance timestamp logging
10. Auto-convert quote → job

Check if anything is UI-only or missing backend logic.

## ✅ **4. INVOICE SYSTEM (FULL CHECK)**

Verify the same production-level workflow:

* Invoice numbering
* Totals & GST
* Payment status
* Stripe payment link creation

* Permissions:

  * Owners: everything
  * Admin: almost everything

* Prevent access to restricted pages
* Team chat + job chat data storage

## ✅ **7. CLIENTS SYSTEM (FUNCTIONALITY TEST)**

Check that:

* Clients can be added

* Attachments persist
* Files link to correct jobs
* Preview works
* Storage path is correct
* Database references are saved

## ✅ **9. SENDGRID IMPLEMENTATION (EMAILS)**

Verify that:

* API keys are loaded via env
* Welcome email
* Quote sent email

## ✅ **11. UI/UX AUDIT (IOS-POLISHED CHECK)**

Inspect every page for:

* Alignment
* Spacing

## ✅ **12. OFFLINE MODE & CLOUD BACKEND CHECK**

Verify:

* App doesn’t break offline
* Local caching exists (if implemented)
* Database sync works when online
* Pages fail gracefully when offline

If missing:
Suggest adding localStorage or service workers later.

* List ALL remaining tasks needed before launch.
* Provide patches and code fixes.
* Optimise the structure where needed.
