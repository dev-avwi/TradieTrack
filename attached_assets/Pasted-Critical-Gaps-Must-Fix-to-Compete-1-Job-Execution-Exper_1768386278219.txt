Critical Gaps (Must Fix to Compete)
1. Job Execution Experience is Fragmented
ServiceM8's killer feature: One unified "job cockpit" where field staff see schedule, checklist, photos, forms, time tracking, and billing in ONE view
Your gap: Staff bounce between multiple screens to complete a job. Too many taps, too much cognitive load
Fix: Build a single "Active Job" screen that's the command center for field work
2. Quote-to-Cash Flow Has Manual Steps
When a client accepts a quote, it should automatically: collect deposit → create scheduled job → eventually convert to invoice
Your gap: These are manual steps that tradies will forget
Fix: Automate the revenue pipeline end-to-end
3. Offline Mode is Not Real Yet
ServiceM8's headline feature: Works in a shed with no signal, syncs when back online
Your gap: Mobile app scaffolds exist but most forms still need live internet
Fix: This is table-stakes for Australian tradies in rural areas
4. Scheduling/Dispatch is Desktop-Only
No drag-and-drop calendar for owners
No visual dispatch board for assigning jobs
Job assignment requests exist but don't surface prominently to owners
Fix: Build a proper visual scheduler with drag-and-drop
Features That Need Polish
5. PDF Quotes/Invoices Need Branding Love
Templates exist but don't feel premium
E-signature flow isn't streamlined
6. Payment Collection is Basic
You have Stripe links, but no:
Tap-to-pay from the field
Stored cards for repeat clients
Payment scheduling
Instant receipts from the job site
7. Reporting is Thin
Dashboard shows metrics but missing:
Quote win rate
Job profitability
Technician utilization
Cashflow forecasting
Per-trade analytics
8. Client Comms Aren't Workflow-Bound
SMS/email templates exist but don't auto-trigger (e.g., "On my way" when job starts, follow-up if quote not accepted in 3 days)
UX Issues
9. Onboarding is Overwhelming
Multiple parallel onboarding flows create confusion
No clear "first win" moment (schedule your first job in under 5 minutes)
Heavy demo data seeding slows things down
10. Mobile/Tablet Parity Incomplete
Some screens still assume desktop layout
5-tap rule violated on key workflows
Forms don't autosave
