Got you. I’ll do three things in one go:

answer your question about whether tradies actually use Tradify daily

design a proper Xero / MYOB / QuickBooks integration flow (the “right way” so it feels legit + saves time)

give you a single Replit “master prompt” to audit the whole job → quote → invoice → payment journey + UX from a tradie’s POV, and make sure nothing is “UI only”.

1) Do tradies actually use Tradify daily?

Yes. Apps like Tradify/ServiceM8 get used daily because they solve boring daily admin pain:

quotes/invoices on-site

scheduling jobs

tracking who’s where

getting paid

keeping records for tax/GST

proof in disputes (timestamps, notes, photos)

Most tradies don’t switch because “the UI is prettier” — they switch when your app:

saves time every day

reduces mistakes

helps them get paid faster

connects cleanly to accounting (Xero/MYOB/QB)

works reliably on phone (offline + low fuss)

doesn’t break their existing workflow

So if TradieTrack becomes the “fastest path from job → paid → books done”, they’ll switch.

2) The accounting integration flow that feels “pro”

Here’s the best practice flow (and what you should build first):

A) Xero integration flow (recommended first in AU)

Goal: tradie invoices in TradieTrack automatically appear in Xero with correct GST + customer + payments.

Step 1 — Connect Xero (Owner only)

Settings → Integrations → Xero → Connect

OAuth login

Choose Xero Organisation (if they have multiple)

Save tokens securely (server-side only)

Step 2 — Mapping (one-time setup wizard)

Default GST setting (GST on/off)

Default Revenue Account (e.g., “Sales”)

Default Payment Account (Bank)

Optional: “Tracking categories” (Xero feature) mapping:

e.g., “Worker” or “Job Type”

Sync customers:

Option A: “Xero is source of truth”

Option B: “TradieTrack is source of truth”

For beta: pick one (I recommend Xero source of truth)

Step 3 — Invoice push rules
When invoice is marked “Sent” in TradieTrack:

Create/Match Contact in Xero

Create Invoice in Xero (with line items, GST, due date)

Save Xero invoice ID back into TradieTrack

Show “Synced to Xero ✅” badge

Step 4 — Payments
If customer pays via Stripe in TradieTrack:

Update invoice status to Paid

Optionally create Xero Payment (or mark invoice paid)

Store payment reference + date

Step 5 — Reconciliation safety
If something fails:

show clear “Sync failed” state

retry button

don’t duplicate invoices (idempotency keys)

✅ Result: tradie does admin once, not twice.

B) MYOB integration flow (later, but similar)

MYOB has API differences, but your UX should be identical:

Connect

Map accounts/GST

Sync contacts

Push invoices

Sync payments

Key point: keep the same “Integration Wizard UI” so it feels consistent.

C) QuickBooks integration flow (same UX, different adapter)

Same exact UI and steps, just swap the backend adapter.

Best architecture:
Build a single “AccountingProvider” interface:

createOrMatchContact()

createInvoice()

recordPayment()

syncStatus()

Then implement:

XeroProvider

MYOBProvider

QuickBooksProvider

3) Single Replit master prompt (adds Xero + full QA + tradie UX)

Paste this into Replit. It’s written so it can check your codebase, find “UI-only”, and implement missing wiring.

✅ REPLIT MASTER QA + XERO INTEGRATION PROMPT (TradieTrack)
Act as a senior QA engineer + product engineer for TradieTrack (tradie job management SaaS). 
Your goal: make TradieTrack a “technically solid beta” where no features are UI-only, all workflows are integrated end-to-end, and UX matches how a real tradie works daily.

========================
SECTION 1 — CORE WORKFLOWS (MUST WORK END-TO-END)
========================
Verify and fix end-to-end flows using realistic seed data:

Business (Owner):
- Name: Cairns Coast Plumbing
- ABN: 12 345 678 910
- Plan: Free then Pro
- Address: 123 Sheridan St, Cairns QLD

Users:
- Owner: Joe (role: Owner)
- Manager: Mia (role: Manager)
- Worker: Liam (role: Worker)

Client:
- Sarah Thompson, 45 Lake St, Cairns QLD, (use a test email)

Jobs:
- Job 1: Fix leaking shower (Scheduled)
- Job 2: Install new vanity (In Progress)

You must ensure ALL buttons and screens perform real backend actions:
1) Create job -> saved in DB
2) Attach client -> persisted
3) Add job location -> address + lat/lng stored
4) Time tracking: start/stop timer -> saved as time entry, linked to job + user
5) Job photos/files -> upload stores file + link to job
6) Quote creation -> correct calculations + GST + quote number
7) Quote preview -> correct template + PDF generation
8) Send quote -> SendGrid sends email with PDF or secure link
9) Client accepts quote -> status accepted, timestamp saved, optionally job status update
10) Convert quote -> invoice -> totals correct
11) Send invoice -> email + payment link works
12) Stripe payment -> invoice becomes paid + receipt is sent
13) Audit log: record key events (sent, accepted, paid, status changes)

Detect any “UI-only” elements and either implement fully or hide behind “Coming Soon” flags for beta.

========================
SECTION 2 — TEAM ROLES + PERMISSIONS (Owner vs Worker UX)
========================
Enforce role-based UX:
- Owner sees: full dashboard, business settings, integrations, team management, reporting, map overview
- Manager sees: similar to owner but limited (no billing plan changes)
- Worker sees: Today’s jobs, assigned jobs, time tracking, job chat, job details, minimal settings

Confirm:
- Worker cannot see billing/subscriptions
- Worker can only view jobs assigned to them (unless permission granted)
- Owner can see all jobs + team locations

Add onboarding that asks:
- business type
- solo vs team
- role
- default settings (GST, invoice terms)
Then routes user to correct dashboard.

========================
SECTION 3 — MAP SYSTEM (OWNER MAP + JOB PINS + TEAM LOCATIONS)
========================
Implement/verify a dedicated Map screen for Owners/Managers:
- Uses Google Maps (or Mapbox) and displays:
  - job pins across region
  - pin color/style by status (Scheduled/In Progress/Completed)
  - small callout on tap: job name, status badge, time, assigned worker
  - filter chips: Today / This week / Completed / Unassigned
- Stores job location in DB with:
  - address
  - lat
  - lng
- Team locations:
  - worker app can share location (dev build required)
  - show worker markers on map with name + last updated timestamp
  - do NOT track in Expo Go if unsupported; instead show “Requires dev build” and disable UI
- Add “Open in Maps” button on job details using stored coordinates.

========================
SECTION 4 — CHAT SYSTEM (TEAM + DIRECT + JOB CHAT)
========================
Verify chat is fully wired (not UI):
- Team group chat for business
- Direct messages: Owner/Manager <-> Worker
- Job-specific chat thread attached to each job
Confirm:
- messages persist in DB
- messages are scoped to business/team
- job chat is visible only to users with access to that job
- include attachments (optional for beta)
- message notifications:
  - in-app badge + local notifications (push can be staged)

========================
SECTION 5 — SENDGRID EMAILS (REAL WORLD QUALITY)
========================
Ensure email flows are real:
- Quote sent
- Invoice sent
- Payment receipt
Requirements:
- API key server-side only
- Verified sender domain (from)
- Reply-To = tradie email
- Pro plan branding:
  - includes business logo/header/footer
  - removes or minimizes “Powered by TradieTrack”
- Free plan:
  - standard template + “Powered by TradieTrack”
Confirm emails render well in Gmail mobile (simple HTML, no broken layout).

========================
SECTION 6 — STRIPE (SUBSCRIPTIONS + CUSTOMER PAYMENTS)
========================
Implement/verify:
A) Subscriptions for TradieTrack billing:
- checkout flow
- webhook updates subscription status + tier
- gating features by tier

B) Customer invoice payments:
- PaymentIntent creation
- success webhook marks invoice paid
- receipts sent
- store payment reference + date

If Stripe Terminal endpoints exist:
- ensure keys/config are valid
- if not configured, hide Terminal UI for beta instead of throwing 500 errors.

========================
SECTION 7 — XERO INTEGRATION (AU-FOCUSED)
========================
Add Xero integration (Owner only):
1) Connect Xero (OAuth)
2) Select Xero organization
3) Mapping wizard:
   - default revenue account
   - GST setting
   - payment/bank account
4) Sync rules:
   - When invoice status becomes “Sent”, push to Xero (create contact if needed, create invoice, save xeroInvoiceId)
   - When invoice is paid in TradieTrack, record payment in Xero (or mark paid)
5) UI shows:
   - “Synced to Xero ✅” or “Sync failed ⚠️ (Retry)”
6) Prevent duplicates using idempotency keys.

========================
SECTION 8 — OFFLINE / RELIABILITY (BETA LEVEL)
========================
Ensure:
- offline banner
- cached data read (jobs, clients)
- queue writes when offline for:
  - time tracking entries
  - job notes
- clean error handling (no crashes, no infinite spinners)

========================
SECTION 9 — FINAL OUTPUT
========================
After auditing and fixing, output:
1) A list of VERIFIED working flows ✅
2) A list of features to hide for beta ⚠️
3) A list of critical bugs MUST fix before App Store ⛔
4) A small “Test Plan” checklist I can follow on my phone

Your quick answers to the build errors you pasted

Those build errors are real and fixable:

react-native-worklets missing → install it:

npx expo install react-native-worklets

Version mismatches:

run: npx expo install --check

update expo-audio, @types/react, typescript to the expected SDK versions

And your Stripe Terminal 500 errors in logs?
That’s almost always:

missing env vars

using test keys but not configured

or calling Terminal APIs in a build that doesn’t support it yet
→ for beta, hide the Terminal UI unless the backend is confirmed configured.
