Input at bottom: “Type a message…”

“Send” button adds to messages list.

Add unread badge on sidebar if there are messages marked unread (you can just mock this logic).

Job Chat (inside Job Detail):

Within Job Detail, add a “Job Chat” section.

Works like Team Chat, but for that job only (jobId scoped).

Mock an initial set of messages per job.

No backend or real-time yet; just keep everything in state.

7. Activity Feed

On the Owner/Manager dashboard, show a card:

“Recent activity”

List items like:

“John started Job ‘Leaking shower repair’”

“Invoice INV-102 marked as Paid”

“Quote Q-305 sent to Sarah Smith”

Use mock data, update when user actions happen if easy.

Add AI buttons:

Job description: “🤖 Rewrite with AI”

Notes: “🤖 Summarise notes”

Quotes: “🤖 Suggest line items”

Invoices: “🤖 Draft invoice email”

Client page: “🤖 Summarise this client”

Dashboard suggestions card: static suggestions

For now, they can just call stub functions that update text with some placeholder content.
