Yep — let’s “pull Replit into the room” by writing a single master message you can paste into Replit Agent (or your Replit project chat) so it works with my brain, not against it.

Copy/paste this into Replit:

You are Replit Agent working with me (Ayden) and my product strategist (ChatGPT). We are preparing TradieTrack for a real public launch. Follow this operating system:

GOAL
- Ship a polished, reliable MVP that real tradies will pay for.
- No fake buttons. No placeholder flows. Everything must work end-to-end.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CORE FLOW (must be perfect)
1) Create Client
2) Create Quote
3) Send Quote -> Customer can view -> Accept -> Signature captured
4) Convert Quote to Job
5) Track Job (status, notes, photos/files)
6) Create Invoice
7) Send Invoice
8) Receive Payment (Stripe)
9) Receipt auto-send
10) Sync data Mobile <-> Web
11) Offline reliability (queue + retry)
12) Notifications reliability

TECH STABILITY REQUIREMENTS
- Crash-free build
- Stripe stable + webhooks correct
- Email deliverability verified
- Maps reliable (if used)
- Loading states everywhere
- Clear error messages
- Secure auth + basic roles
- Basic analytics logs (events for funnel)

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU (Replit) RIGHT NOW
A) Produce a “Launch Readiness Checklist” with pass/fail tests for each core flow step.
B) Audit the codebase against the checklist and list:
   - blockers (must fix before launch)
   - high priority fixes
   - nice-to-haves
C) Implement fixes in the correct order:
   1) Data correctness + payments + auth
   2) Quote/Invoice sending reliability
   3) Offline + sync + retry logic
   4) UI polish + loading/error states
D) Add a proper production configuration plan:
   - env vars
   - Stripe test vs live
   - webhook endpoint + signature verification
   - email provider config (SPF/DKIM/DMARC guidance)
   - database migrations/backups
E) Create a “Release Plan”:
   - versioning
   - staging vs production
   - smoke tests
   - rollback steps

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
1) Current State Summary (what works / what is risky)
2) Checklist Table (Feature -> Test -> Status -> Fix needed)
3) Fix Plan (ordered steps)
4) PR-style Change Log (what you changed)
5) Next Actions for Ayden (what I should do today)

IMPORTANT RULES
- If you are unsure, do not guess: create a task list and surface unknowns.
- Prefer reliable boring solutions over clever ones.
- No UI changes that break flow.
- Always add tests or at least reproducible manual test steps.
- Every change must be verifiable.

Start now by generating the checklist and running the audit.


Now, on my side, here’s how we run this “two-brain” workflow so it’s actually powerful:

How you’ll use me + Replit together (simple loop)

You paste that into Replit.

Replit replies with its checklist + blockers.

You paste Replit’s blockers list back to me.

I’ll:

prioritize what matters for launch

tell you what’s “launch-stopping” vs “post-launch”

write the exact messages to send back to Replit to implement fixes cleanly

help you craft the launch + marketing steps (website, demo vid, pricing, first users)

Getting ready to publish + “make it known” (what matters most)

If you’re close to launch, the real priorities are:

Payments + webhooks (no broken billing, no double charges)

Quote/Invoice sending reliability (email deliverability + logs)

Airtight onboarding (first user can succeed in 2 minutes)

No clunky steps in your core flow (your checklist already nails this)

Crash-free + offline safety (at minimum: queue actions, retry, clear errors)

If you want, paste here what platform you’re launching first (web only vs mobile + web) and what stack you’re using (Firebase/Supabase/custom DB, Expo/React Native, etc.) — but you don’t have to. Easiest next step is:

Send me whatever Replit returns after you paste the master prompt, and I’ll stitch our next move.
