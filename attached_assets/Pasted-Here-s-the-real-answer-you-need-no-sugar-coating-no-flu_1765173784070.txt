# ⭐ 2. FEATURE PRIORITY LIST (What MUST be perfect first)

Tradies absolutely **do not care about fancy features first**.

They care about:

---

## **🔥 Priority Level 1 — High Value Essentials**

These must work flawlessly:

### **1️⃣ Job Creation (fast, simple, no confusion)**

* Name
* Address
* Job notes
* Client
* Assigned team member
* Job status
  **This screen must look clean and BIG.**

### **2️⃣ Photos (instantly upload)**

Tradies take photos every single job.
This is a non-negotiable killer feature.

### **3️⃣ Quotes & Invoices (simple)**

Doesn’t need full accounting yet — just:

* Items
* Labour
* Send as PDF
* Mark paid

### **4️⃣ Calendar / Schedule / Dispatch board**

Where the boss assigns jobs.
Where the worker sees today’s jobs.

### **5️⃣ Client management**

Phone
Email
Address
Job history

Stupid simple.

---

## **🔥 Priority Level 2 — Money Makers**

After essentials are stable:

### • Time tracking

### • Job costing

### • Offline mode

### • Notifications

### • Team tracking map

### • Job templates

### • Saved materials list

### • Recurring jobs

---

## **🔥 Priority Level 3 — Premium/Advanced**

These don’t matter for launch:

* Tap to Pay
* Inventory
* Purchase orders
* PDF form builder
* Asset management
* Smart automations

You can add all of these later to upgrade tradies into the paid tier.

---

# ⭐ 3. HOW TO ENSURE REAL TRADIE VALUE (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART)

The only true validation is **putting the app in the hands of 3–10 real Cairns tradies for 1 week**.

Here’s how you guarantee they say
**“Yep, this is better than what I’m using.”**

---

## **Step 1 — Pick your first 5 tradies:**

* 1 plumber
* 1 electrician
* 1 carpenter
* 1 handyman
* 1 landscaper

Local Cairns businesses:

* JNF Plumbing
* Daniel Smith Plumbing
* FNQ Electrical
* Trademark Carpentry
* Your mum’s LinkUp2Care tradie contacts
* Anyone in your neighbourhood

---

## **Step 2 — Ask ONLY these 3 questions**

This unlocks everything.

### **Q1: What annoys you most about the app you use now?**

Tradify / ServiceM8 complaints are always the same:

* Too complex
* Too slow
* Too many taps
* Can’t find anything
* Takes too long to make a job
* Invoices too confusing

---

### **Q2: Which part of your day is the biggest time-waster?**

Answers normally:

* Writing notes
* Uploading photos
* Sending invoices
* Driving back to office to do paperwork
* Tracking workers manually

---

### **Q3: If an app could save you 30 mins a day — what would it need to do?**

This is your GOLD.

Tradies literally design your feature list for you.

---

## **Step 3 — Validate the App With Real Jobs**

Have them do real actions:

* Create a real job
* Assign a worker
* Upload photos
* Complete job
* Create invoice
* Send invoice
* Mark paid

If they can do ALL that smoothly —
your app is **100% good enough for paid customers**.

---

## **Step 4 — Observe silently**

Do NOT explain your app to them.
Just watch.

If they get confused:
→ Fix the UI
If they get lost:
→ Fix navigation
If they tap wrong things:
→ Make buttons bigger
If they smile/laugh:
→ You nailed it.

# ⭐ 4. CAIRNS-SPECIFIC TRADIE MARKETING STRATEGY

### **Step 1 — Dominate Cairns Facebook Groups**

Post demo videos weekly:

* Cairns Trades & Services
* Cairns Buy Swap Sell
* Cairns Community

Show 20-second clips of:

* Creating a job
* Sending an invoice
* Team map live tracking

---

### **Step 2 — Partner with Cairns businesses**

* Tool shops
* Cairns Total Electrical
* Plumbing supply stores
* FNQ trade schools

Offer:
**“Free 3-month TradieTrack plan for Cairns locals.”**

---

### **Step 3 — Visit job sites**

Just like ServiceM8 did in Darwin.

Walk up to tradies:
**“Hey mate, I’m building an app for tradies in Cairns — want to try it for free and tell me what could be better?”**

Boom. Instant customer.

---

### **Step 4 — Free plan + paid upgrade**

Your best model:

**FREE:**

* Jobs
* Clients
* Photos
* Basic invoices

**PAID:**

* Team tracking
* Offline mode
* Recurring jobs
* Quotes
* Custom branding
* Tap to Pay

---

### **Step 5 — Build your testimonial wall**

Before you go global, get Cairns tradies on video saying:

**“This app saved me 1 hour a day.”**
**“So much easier than ServiceM8.”**
**“I switched my whole business to it.”**

That is marketing GOLD.

---

# ⭐ FINAL ANSWER — Will tradies use your app?

⚡ YES — IF you:

### **☑ Make job creation insanely simple**

### **☑ Make photos dead fast**

### **☑ Make scheduling clean and visual**

### **☑ Let them invoice instantly**

### **☑ Don’t try to do too much at once**

### **☑ Test with local Cairns tradies asap**

If your prototype nails those 5 things…
**your app will beat half the market instantly.**
