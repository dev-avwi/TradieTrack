Act as a senior QA engineer + product lead for TradieTrack (web + mobile Expo). 
Goal: make TradieTrack a technically solid beta ready for real tradies and app store standards.

PART A — PRICING UPDATE (DO THIS FIRST)
1) Update subscription tiers everywhere (UI + backend + Stripe config):
   - Pro: $49/month
   - Team: $59/month base + $29/month per additional worker
2) Ensure pricing appears consistently in:
   - Pricing page(s)
   - Upgrade modal(s)
   - Billing settings
   - Stripe Products/Prices mapping
   - Any plan checks (feature gates)
3) Ensure plan entitlements match:
   - Pro: removes “Powered by TradieTrack” or upgrades branding, adds custom email/PDF branding
   - Team: enables team roles, team location/map, dispatch features, chat permissions

PART B — FIND “UI-ONLY / HALF-DONE” FEATURES
Scan the codebase and list every feature that is:
- visible in UI but missing backend routes
- has TODO / placeholder logic
- returns mock data only
For each, do ONE of:
- implement fully
- hide behind “Coming soon (beta)”
- remove from navigation for beta

PART C — END-TO-END WORKFLOWS (MUST PASS)
Verify these flows are fully wired and tested:
1) Auth: signup/login/me, session persistence, logout
2) Roles:
   - Owner/Manager vs Worker dashboards differ
   - Workers cannot access billing/admin pages
   - Owners can invite/manage team, set roles
3) Job journey:
   - create job with address + lat/lng
   - job statuses: New/Scheduled/In Progress/Completed/Invoiced
   - time tracking start/stop tied to job
   - job photos upload + list + delete
4) Map system:
   - Map page shows all jobs as pins using stored lat/lng
   - Pin shows job status badge (Completed/Scheduled/etc)
   - Filter by status/date
   - Clicking pin opens job detail
   - Team locations appear if Team plan enabled
   - Owner can see all; workers see only allowed scope
5) Chat:
   - Team group chat exists and persists
   - Job-specific chat exists per job
   - Direct chat Owner↔Worker exists
   - Permissions are correct (workers only see their team + assigned jobs)
6) Quotes:
   - create from job, itemised lines, GST totals correct
   - live preview matches final PDF
   - quote number unique
   - send quote email triggers SendGrid
   - customer acceptance updates quote status + timestamp + (optional) job status
7) Invoices:
   - convert from quote, invoice number unique
   - PDF generation clean (multi-page safe)
   - send invoice email + payment link
   - status updates Draft/Sent/Paid/Overdue
8) Payments:
   - Stripe subscriptions for TradieTrack (test mode) update business plan in DB via webhooks
   - Client pays invoice via Stripe (and Connect if enabled) updates invoice to Paid + receipt email
9) Offline / resilience:
   - If offline, show OfflineBanner
   - cache last data
   - queue changes if possible (or clearly block with message)
   - no crashes on failed requests; proper loading/error states

PART D — APP STORE / PLAY STORE BETA READINESS
1) Fix expo doctor issues:
   - install react-native-worklets (required for Reanimated)
   - align package versions to Expo SDK expectations
2) Ensure iOS permissions have clear copy (camera, photos, location)
3) Ensure secrets are server-side only (Stripe keys, SendGrid)
4) Ensure Terms + Privacy Policy routes exist and are linked in-app
5) Confirm no “Expo Go limitations” are relied on (use Dev Build)

PART E — SERVICE M8 COMPARISON CHECKLIST
Compare TradieTrack to ServiceM8 in these categories and report gaps:
- fast daily workflow (today jobs, quick actions)
- quote/invoice creation speed & preview polish
- job status + scheduling feel
- photo attachments
- on-site payments options (Stripe Terminal later ok)
- team dispatch + map view
- professional templates + branding
For each gap: propose the smallest fix to match or beat ServiceM8.
