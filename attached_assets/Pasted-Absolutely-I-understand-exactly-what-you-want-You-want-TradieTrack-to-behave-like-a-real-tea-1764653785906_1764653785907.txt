Absolutely — I understand exactly what you want:
You want **TradieTrack to behave like a *real* team management app**, not just a job manager.

That means:

* ✔ A live map of jobs
* ✔ Completed vs scheduled pins
* ✔ Team member locations
* ✔ Team chat + direct messaging
* ✔ Job-specific chats
* ✔ Owner command centre

So let’s update the **Replit Master Testing Prompt** to include EVERYTHING you just described — especially the new map/location system and team communication layer.

Below is the **updated + complete final version** you can paste directly into Replit AI.

This is the **best possible version**, combining everything:

* real-world tradie workflows
* location systems
* job pins
* team tracking
* chats
* map UI
* backend checks
* Stripe
* SendGrid
* PDF legitimacy
* roles
* permissions
* subscriptions
* offline basics

This is the **ultimate prompt**.

# ⭐ **UPDATED REPLIT MASTER TESTING PROMPT (PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT)**

——————————————

🧠 **REPLIT MASTER TESTING PROMPT — FINAL BETA READINESS CHECK**

I want you to act as a QA engineer + SaaS product tester for my app **TradieTrack**, a job/quote/invoice/payments/team/location management platform for tradies.

Your job is to verify that the ENTIRE app is a **technically solid beta** — nothing should be UI-only unless marked as “coming soon”. Every visible feature must link to real backend logic.

You must test all features using **realistic mock data** and ensure that:

✔ Job workflows behave exactly like a real tradie business
✔ Stripe works for subscriptions & invoice payments
✔ SendGrid sends real emails (with templates + branding rules)
✔ PDFs are clean, accurate, and professional
✔ Location + map + team tracking logic works
✔ Chats (team chat + job chat + private chat) are wired to backend
✔ Roles & permissions work
✔ No broken buttons or placeholders
✔ No dead ends
✔ No silent failures
✔ All routes exist
✔ Database writes happen properly

Use this mock data in all operations:

**Business:**

* Name: “Cairns Coast Plumbing”
* ABN: 12 345 678 910
* Email: [cairnscoastplumbing@example.com](mailto:cairnscoastplumbing@example.com)
* Phone: 0400 123 456
* Plan: Free → then Pro
* Address: 123 Sheridan St, Cairns QLD

**Clients:**

* Sarah Thompson — [sarah@example.com](mailto:sarah@example.com)
* David Reid — [david@example.com](mailto:david@example.com)

**Jobs:**

1. “Fix leaking shower” — Sarah
2. “Install new vanity” — Sarah
3. “Blocked drain at cafe” — David

**Team Members:**

* Joe (Owner)
* Sam (Technician)
* Riley (Apprentice)

### ✔ 1. CORE WORKFLOW TESTING

——————————————————

Test the entire workflow end-to-end:

1. Create job → save to DB
2. Convert job → quote
3. Quote preview updates live
4. Send quote email via SendGrid
5. Client receives email + PDF
6. Client accepts quote
7. Quote status → Accepted
8. Convert to invoice
9. Send invoice → email template + PDF
10. Client pays via Stripe test card
11. Invoice status → Paid
12. Payment receipt email sent

Check that **all backend routes exist** for each step.

——————————————————

### ✔ 2. PDF GENERATION & LEGITIMACY

——————————————————

Verify PDFs include:

* Tradie logo (Pro only)
* Business details + ABN
* Client info
* Line items
* Totals (GST correct)
* Dates
* Quote/invoice numbers
* Acceptance/paid timestamps
* Clean layout
* No broken formatting

——————————————————

### ✔ 3. SENDGRID EMAIL WORKFLOWS

——————————————————

Check that:

* Verified sender is used
* Reply-to is the tradie email
* Templates exist for:

*Quote sent*
*Invoice sent*
*Payment receipt*
*Job update*

**Pro plan branding:**

* Logo included
* Footer included
* “Powered by TradieTrack” removed or minimised

**Free plan:**

* No custom branding
* “Powered by TradieTrack” visible

——————————————————

### ✔ 4. STRIPE WORKFLOWS

——————————————————

Test:

1. Tradie subscription (Test mode)
2. Invoice payment (Stripe Connect)
3. Webhook correctly updates:

* business.subscription_status
* invoice.status
* payment records

——————————————————

### ✔ 5. MAP / LOCATION SYSTEM (NEW FEATURE)

——————————————————

Ensure this is fully wired:

### **A. Job Map View**

On the map page:

* Jobs appear as pins
* Pin colour changes by status:

  * Blue: Scheduled
  * Orange: In Progress
  * Green: Completed
* Each pin has:

  * Job title
  * Client name
  * Status
  * Tap → opens job details

Check that:

* Map loads from real API (Google Maps / Leaflet)
* Coordinates are stored in DB for jobs
* If tradie types an address → geocode to lat/lng
* Map refreshes when job status changes

### **B. Team Member Locations (NEW)**

If enabled:

* Team members show as different icons
* Owner can see:

  * Last known location
  * Timestamp
* Must verify:

The “share location” button actually calls a backend update function.
No fake UI.

### **C. Job Route Planning**

If route/“open in maps” link exists:

Confirm:

* It uses stored coordinates
* Generates correct Google Maps link

——————————————————

### ✔ 6. TEAM CHAT + JOB CHAT

——————————————————

Confirm:

**Team Chat:**

* All members see messages
* Messages save to DB
* Real-time/subscription works
* Attachments (photos) upload properly

**Job Chat (Per job):**

* Messages link to specific job ID
* Team sees history
* Owner sees everything
* Attachments work

**Direct messages (Owner → Tech):**

* Private channel exists
* Only correct users can view

——————————————————

### ✔ 7. ROLES & PERMISSIONS

——————————————————

Check:

* Owner full access
* Manager access but limited billing
* Technician limited to assigned jobs
* Apprentice view-only except checklists

Enforce in backend:

No UI-only restrictions.

——————————————————

### ✔ 8. OFFLINE & ERROR HANDLING

——————————————————

Check:

* No crashes on slow internet
* All API calls show loading state
* All failures show error messages
* No operations silently fail

——————————————————

### ✔ 9. MAP + TIME TRACKING (FINAL)

——————————————————

Test:

1. “Start timer” on job
2. Timer runs in background
3. User can pause/stop
4. Total time saved in DB
5. Time converts into invoice line item (optional)

Check:

“Use current location”:

* Captures location
* Saves to last_known_location table

——————————————————

### ✔ 10. FINAL CHECK: IS THIS A “PROFESSIONAL, REAL-WORLD BETA”?

——————————————————

At the end provide:

* All workflows that passed
* All items partially implemented
* All broken links or UI-only buttons
* All missing backend endpoints
* All bugs
* A list of must-fix items before launch

Use the codebase, not assumptions.
