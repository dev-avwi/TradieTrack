Yep – it’s 100% ready to move into “serious testing” mode now.
Now it’s less about design and more about proving it works like a real product.

I’ll give you A, B, C and D all together:

⸻

A. Full testing checklist (what to run through now)

Do these flows as if you’re a real tradie:
	1.	Account + onboarding
	•	Sign up (email / password)
	•	Verify email (if you’ve added it)
	•	Complete onboarding: business name, trade, ABN (if used), logo, team size.
	•	Log out, log back in.
	2.	Jobs & clients
	•	Create a new client.
	•	Create a new job for that client.
	•	Add notes, address, due date, priority.
	•	Change job status (New → Scheduled → In progress → Completed).
	•	Archive / delete a job (if allowed).
	3.	Quotes → invoices → payments
	•	Create a quote from a job.
	•	Add line items, GST, terms.
	•	Save, preview PDF, “Send” (trigger SendGrid in test/sandbox).
	•	Mark quote as accepted → have it auto-create a job or invoice.
	•	Create invoice, mark as paid (or run a test payment with Stripe test keys).
	4.	Files & activity
	•	Upload before/after photos to a job.
	•	Attach documents (PDF, image).
	•	Check they show correctly in the job timeline.
	5.	Notifications & email
	•	Trigger every email you have:
	•	welcome
	•	quote sent
	•	invoice sent
	•	payment receipt
	•	Make sure the emails:
	•	use the right logo/name
	•	don’t say “Replit” or test stuff
	•	links go back to the right URLs.
	6.	Team / roles (if implemented)
	•	Create a second user in the same business.
	•	Check:
	•	owner vs staff permissions
	•	staff can’t change billing/settings if that’s how you designed it
	•	job assignment works.
	7.	Error & edge cases
	•	Try submit a form with missing fields.
	•	Wrong password.
	•	Invalid email.
	•	Very long client name/job description.
	•	No internet (turn Wi-Fi off on your phone and see what breaks).

Write down every bug, weird message, or ugly screen in a little “Bug log” doc.

B. UX polish checklist (make it feel top-tier)

Walk through every screen and check:
	1.	Consistency
	•	Same font sizes used for headings/body.
	•	Same button shapes, radius, and shadows.
	•	Same blue/orange brand colours everywhere.
	2.	Spacing & alignment
	•	No elements “stuck” to the edge.
	•	Cards sized evenly (your 2×2 layout).
	•	Nothing looks left-heavy (that old unused column issue).
	3.	Copy & micro-text
	•	Clear titles: “Create Job”, “Send Quote”, etc.
	•	Helpful helper text under fields (e.g. “This is what your client will see on the invoice”).
	•	No lorem ipsum / placeholder gibberish.
	4.	States
	•	Empty states (no jobs, no invoices yet) have friendly messages and a big CTA button.
	•	Loading states (spinner or skeletons).
	•	Error states (“Something went wrong – try again or contact support”).
	5.	Mobile vs desktop
	•	Test on your phone in portrait.
	•	Check buttons big enough for thumbs.
	•	Bottom nav on mobile feels natural and not cramped.

C. Backend + offline + “real product” setup

This is where you make it production-grade:
	1.	Choose and lock in your production backend
	•	One real database (e.g. Supabase / Postgres / PlanetScale / Neon / Railway).
	•	Separate TEST and PROD environments:
	•	SUPABASE_URL_TEST, SUPABASE_URL_PROD (or equivalent)
	•	Same idea for Stripe and SendGrid keys.
	2.	Data model sanity check
Make sure your tables/entities cover:
	•	Users
	•	Businesses / Accounts
	•	Team members
	•	Clients
	•	Jobs
	•	Quotes
	•	Invoices
	•	Payments
	•	Files (or file references)
	•	Notifications / Email log
	•	Audit log (optional but pro)
	3.	Stripe (for your subscriptions)
	•	Use Stripe test mode now.
	•	Plans: Free, Pro, maybe Business.
	•	Webhooks:
	•	checkout.session.completed
	•	invoice.payment_succeeded
	•	On webhook → update user’s plan and status.
	4.	SendGrid / email
	•	Authenticate your sending domain (support@tradietrack.app or similar).
	•	Make sure all email templates use:
	•	your logo
	•	your brand colours
	•	correct links back to app.
	5.	Offline + sync idea
	•	Short term: make sure if internet drops while filling a form, user doesn’t lose everything (save draft in localStorage/IndexedDB).
	•	Medium term: local cache of:
	•	last X jobs
	•	last X clients
	•	last X quotes/invoices
	•	When connection returns → sync back to backend.
You don’t have to build full offline right now, but plan it.

D. What’s next after tests? (Real-world steps)

Once you’ve done a test pass yourself:
	1.	Fix the obvious bugs + rough edges.
	2.	Invite 2–3 beta tradies
	•	Give them:
	•	Their own login
	•	A simple “Getting started” guide (1 page or short Loom video)
	•	Ask them to use it for at least a week for:
	•	creating jobs
	•	sending at least one quote/invoice
	•	saving at least one client.
	3.	Collect feedback
	•	What confused them?
	•	What was slow?
	•	What did they love?
	•	What’s missing for them to switch from their current system?
	4.	Decide your v1
	•	Freeze new features.
	•	Only fix bugs and polish.
	•	Lock pricing (maybe Free during beta + future Pro).
	5.	Then: soft launch
	•	Small landing page with your new logo.
	•	Clear value: “Job + quotes + invoices app for Cairns tradies.”
	•	Simple “Request early access” form.

If you like, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a single Replit “master testing prompt” you paste so it knows exactly what to check,
or
	•	Help you design the beta tester guide (what you send to the first tradies so they know how to use it).
