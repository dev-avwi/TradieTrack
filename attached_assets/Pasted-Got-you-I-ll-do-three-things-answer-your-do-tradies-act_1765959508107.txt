Got you. I’ll do three things:

answer your “do tradies actually use Tradify daily?” question properly (realistic + non-hype)

give you a clean Xero integration flow (AU GST-friendly)

give you a Replit prompt that makes it check the whole app journey + Xero flow so nothing is “UI-only”

Then I’ll also fix your Expo/EAS build error (react-native-worklets + version mismatches).

1) Do tradies actually use Tradify daily?

Yes — the tradies who pay for Tradify/ServiceM8 types of tools usually use them every day, because it replaces:

job diary / calendar

quotes + invoicing

client database

getting paid

job photos

team scheduling

But switching is hard. A tradie will only fully switch if you nail these 5 “daily” moments:

The 5 moments that decide if they stay

“I can find today’s jobs in 2 taps.”

“I can quote fast without thinking.”

“Customer receives a legit PDF + pay link.”

“I can mark paid + it’s recorded properly.”

“It doesn’t break when reception drops.”

If TradieTrack makes those smoother than Tradify/ServiceM8, they will switch — especially smaller Cairns teams. But the biggest lock-in is accounting integrations + history.

So yeah: your UI can be better, but switching happens when the workflow is safer + faster + more reliable, and when the accounting side is painless.

2) Xero integration flow (the “correct” way for AU tradies)
What you’re building

Two types of Xero integration:

A) Bookkeeping sync (quotes/invoices/payments in TradieTrack → automatically appear in Xero)

B) Contacts sync (clients in TradieTrack ↔ contacts in Xero)

Minimum viable Xero integration (what actually matters)

Core objects

Contacts (customers)

Invoices (ACCREC)

Payments (optional but very valuable)

Items / Products (optional)

Tax rates (GST on/off)

Recommended AU workflow

Step 0 — Onboarding toggle
During onboarding (Owner only):

“Do you use Xero?” Yes/No

If Yes → “Connect Xero” (OAuth)

Select:

default GST behaviour (GST registered or not)

default revenue account code (e.g. 200 Sales)

payment account (bank account in Xero) if syncing payments

optional tracking categories (e.g. “Trade Type”, “Team Member”)

Step 1 — Map TradieTrack → Xero fields
When you generate an invoice in TradieTrack:

Client → Xero Contact

Invoice line items → Xero LineItems

GST → Xero TaxType

Invoice number → Reference/InvoiceNumber (be consistent)

Job ID → Xero “Reference” field (super useful)

Status: Draft / Authorised (you decide)

Usually: Draft in Xero until paid OR “Authorised when sent”

Step 2 — Sync triggers
You need clear rules:

On “Send Invoice” → create/update Xero invoice

On “Mark Paid” OR Stripe webhook success → create Xero payment

On “Edit client” → update Xero contact (optional)

Step 3 — Conflict rules
If invoice exists in Xero:

if TradieTrack is source-of-truth → update Xero

if Xero is source-of-truth → lock invoice edits in TradieTrack once pushed

For tradies, the simplest:
✅ TradieTrack owns invoices until exported/pushed
✅ once pushed, lock invoice fields except “notes” and “attachments”

Step 4 — Accounting safety

Store the Xero tenant ID

Store contact IDs + invoice IDs

Add sync status badges:

“Not connected”

“Ready to sync”

“Synced”

“Sync error” (with message + retry)

Step 5 — First version shortcut (if you want to ship faster)
Before full OAuth sync, ship:

“Export invoice to Xero CSV”

“Export payments report CSV”
That alone wins trust quickly while you finish OAuth.

3) Replit Master QA Prompt (updated to include Maps + Team + Xero flow)

Copy/paste this into Replit:

Act as a senior QA engineer + product tester for TradieTrack (web + mobile). 
Goal: prove the app is a technically solid beta: nothing is “UI-only”, all workflows are fully wired to backend, reliable, and fit a real tradie daily routine.

————————————
0) TEST ACCOUNTS TO CREATE (must work)
————————————
Create/seed these accounts via API/DB seeds or UI flows:

A) OWNER account (Business owner)
- Email: owner+test@tradietrack.app
- Role: OWNER
- Business: Cairns Coast Plumbing
- Plan: Free first, then Pro
- Business settings set: ABN, address, logo, GST enabled, invoice footer terms

B) MANAGER account
- Email: manager+test@tradietrack.app
- Role: MANAGER

C) WORKER/TRADIE account
- Email: tradie+test@tradietrack.app
- Role: WORKER
- Limited access permissions (cannot edit billing, cannot edit business settings)

All 3 must be in same team/business and permissions must be enforced.

————————————
1) CORE DAILY JOURNEY TESTS (must be end-to-end)
————————————
1. Create client -> Create job -> Schedule job -> Add location -> Start time tracking -> Add photos -> Mark complete
2. From job: Create quote -> live preview -> send to client email -> client accepts -> quote becomes accepted -> convert to invoice
3. Send invoice -> client email gets PDF and/or view link -> Stripe payment -> invoice status updates to Paid -> receipt email sent
4. Offline behavior: simulate network drop during job save, quote save, time start/stop. Ensure no crashes, clear error, retry works.

Confirm: every visible button hits a real API route and updates DB; no placeholders.

————————————
2) MAP PAGE / DISPATCH + LOCATION SYSTEM (owner/team)
————————————
Build/verify an Owner Map page:
- Uses Google Maps (or Mapbox) properly
- Shows all jobs as pins clustered by zoom level
- Each pin shows status badge (Scheduled/In Progress/Completed/Overdue)
- Clicking pin opens job preview card (client name, job title, status, quick actions)
- Job location is NOT UI-only:
  - On job create/edit: address saved to DB
  - If geocode enabled: save lat/lng too
  - Map uses lat/lng for pin placement
  - “Open in Maps” uses stored data correctly

Team location sharing:
- /api/team/locations returns members with lastKnownLat/lng + timestamp
- Worker app can optionally share location (if enabled + permitted)
- Map shows team members separately from job pins
- Privacy: worker can toggle share on/off; owner sees status

Dispatch board (if present):
- Drag jobs to assign worker
- Changes persist, reflect in worker view immediately
- Role enforcement: WORKER cannot reassign others unless allowed

Expo limitation check:
- If running in Expo Go, location tracking should show “requires development build” not break.
- In dev build, ensure permission prompts and background location config exist.

————————————
3) TEAM CHAT + JOB CHAT (must be real-time / stored)
————————————
Verify:
- Team group chat room for the business
- Job-specific chat threads attached to each job
- Owner/Manager can DM specific tradie
- Permissions:
  - Worker can read only their assigned job chats + team chat
  - Owner/Manager can see all
- Messages:
  - Stored in DB (not client-only)
  - Read receipts optional
  - Push notifications planned: if not fully working, hide toggle or mark “coming soon”
- Attachments optional: if present, ensure uploaded file persists and permission enforced

————————————
4) EMAIL + PDF SYSTEM (SendGrid) (must be legit)
————————————
Ensure “Send Quote” and “Send Invoice” buttons:
- Generate PDF successfully (no broken layout)
- Attach PDF OR provide secure link
- Email sends via SendGrid server-side only
- Verified sending domain used
- Reply-To set to tradie email
- Templates exist: quote sent, invoice sent, receipt sent

Pro branding:
- If Plan=Pro: logo/header/footer applied on emails + PDFs
- If Plan=Free: show “Powered by TradieTrack” and no custom branding

PDF correctness tests:
- Long descriptions wrap properly
- Multi-page invoice works
- GST totals accurate
- ABN + business details always present

————————————
5) STRIPE (subscriptions + customer payments)
————————————
Subscription billing:
- Stripe webhooks update subscription tier/status correctly
- No UI-only upgrade screens

Customer invoice payments:
- Stripe checkout/payment intent works
- Invoice marked Paid only after Stripe success webhook
- Store transaction ref + paid timestamp

Stripe Terminal:
- If terminal endpoints error (500), show proper error and disable feature until configured.
- Do not leave “Collect payment” button working if token creation fails.

————————————
6) XERO INTEGRATION FLOW (design + verify)
————————————
If Xero integration is enabled:
- Owner can connect Xero via OAuth
- Store tenant id and tokens securely
- Map fields:
  - TradieTrack client -> Xero Contact
  - TradieTrack invoice -> Xero ACCREC invoice
  - Tax/GST mapping correct for AU
- Sync triggers:
  - On Send Invoice -> create/update Xero invoice
  - On Paid -> create Xero payment (optional)
- Provide sync badges: Not connected / Ready / Synced / Error
- If not implemented fully: hide UI or label as “coming soon (beta)” and prevent broken flows

————————————
7) “NO HALF-DONE FEATURES” AUDIT (critical)
————————————
Scan every page and every CTA:
- If it doesn’t hit backend + persist data -> remove/hide from beta
- Create a list of all UI items that are placeholders and either implement or hide

————————————
8) OUTPUT
————————————
Give me:
- ✅ confirmed working flows
- ❌ broken flows with root cause
- ⚠️ risky areas (offline, auth, webhooks, background tasks)
- A “must-fix before publish” list (top 10)
- A “safe for beta, improve later” list
Make changes in code to fix critical issues.

4) Your EAS build error (why it’s happening + fix)

Your logs are super clear:

The real build blocker

react-native-reanimated needs react-native-worklets and it’s missing.

Run this in the mobile folder:

npx expo install react-native-worklets


Then fix the version mismatches:

npx expo install --check


Or explicitly:

npx expo install expo-audio@~1.1.0
npx expo install @types/react@~19.1.10
npm i -D typescript@~5.9.2


Then rebuild:

eas build --profile development --platform ios


(That should remove the Podfile/Reanimated validation failure.)

5) Real-world “phone testing script” (Owner vs Tradie in different suburbs)

Use this exactly:

Scenario: Owner in Cairns City, tradie in Smithfield

Log in as Owner

Create client + job with address in Smithfield

Assign job to WORKER account

Open Map page (Owner) → confirm job pin appears + status badge

Log in as Worker on another device (or logout/login)

Worker opens job → taps “Start time tracking”

Worker shares location ON (if enabled)

Owner map should now show the tradie location marker moving (or timestamp updating)

In job chat: Owner messages “Confirm you’re on site?”

Worker replies + uploads a photo

Worker marks job completed

Owner sees job status change and pin updates (Completed)

If any part doesn’t sync immediately → that’s exactly what to fix before launch.
