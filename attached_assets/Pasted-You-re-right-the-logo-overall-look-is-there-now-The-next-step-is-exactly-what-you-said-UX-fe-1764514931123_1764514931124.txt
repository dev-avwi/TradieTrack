You’re right – the logo + overall look is there now.
The next step is exactly what you said: UX + features + offline + backend.

Here’s a solid plan you can actually work through and also feed into Replit.

⸻

1️⃣ UX & Layout – Full App Checklist

Go screen by screen (Dashboard, Jobs, Quotes, Invoices, Clients, Calendar, Files, Settings, etc.) and check:

A. Navigation & structure
	•	Bottom nav:
	•	Home / Jobs / Clients / Invoices / More are always visible.
	•	Current tab clearly highlighted.
	•	Back/close buttons always obvious on sub-pages.
	•	No pages feel “left aligned” or with weird unused columns.
	•	Content max width is consistent (e.g. max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;).
	•	Demo/real mode clearly labelled (so tradie knows where they are).

B. Visual consistency
	•	Same fonts and sizes for:
	•	Page titles (e.g. “Jobs”, “Invoices”).
	•	Section headings (“Today’s Schedule”, “Recent Activity”).
	•	Button styles (primary = blue, secondary = outline, danger = red).
	•	Cards: same corner radius, shadow, padding.
	•	Icons: same outline/weight and distance from text.
	•	Spacing:
	•	16–24px padding inside cards.
	•	24–32px gaps between sections.
	•	No random cramped areas.

C. Key flows feel “obvious”

Do these WITHOUT thinking too hard:
	•	Create Job → add client → set date/time → save.
	•	Convert Quote → Job → Invoice.
	•	Mark Invoice as Paid.
	•	Add file/photos to a Job.
	•	View Today’s Schedule.
	•	Find a past job by client name.

If any step feels like “wait, where is that?”, add a button or micro-copy.

D. Empty states & error states

For every main list, test when it’s empty:
	•	Jobs list empty → show:
	•	Icon + text (“No jobs yet – create your first job”)
	•	Big primary button “Create Job”.
	•	Quotes, Invoices, Clients – same pattern.
	•	Calendar empty → “No jobs scheduled today – schedule work”.

Error states:
	•	Failed to save job (e.g. network off) → show a small toast “Couldn’t save, will retry” or clear error.
	•	Stripe or SendGrid errors → show simple message:
	•	“Unable to connect to payments right now. Please try again.”

E. Loading states
	•	When you open Dashboard with real data:
	•	Show skeleton cards / subtle loading placeholders – not white flashes.
	•	When creating job/quote/invoice:
	•	Button shows loading spinner and disables to avoid double-clicks.

F. Mobile responsiveness
	•	Test on:
	•	iPhone 13/14 size.
	•	Small Android size (e.g. ~360px width).
	•	Make sure:
	•	Tables become stacked cards.
	•	No horizontal scrolling.
	•	Bottom navigation never overlaps content.

2️⃣ Feature & Workflow Checklist

Walk through each module as if you’re a tradie.

A. Account, roles & onboarding
	•	Sign up flow:
	•	Email/password or Continue with Google works.
	•	Email verification (if you’ve enabled it) actually sends via SendGrid.
	•	Business onboarding asks:
	•	Business name, trade type, ABN (optional), timezone, currency.
	•	Roles:
	•	Owner / Admin / Worker.
	•	Owner can invite team; workers can’t see billing, only jobs & relevant clients.

B. Jobs
	•	Can:
	•	Create / edit / delete jobs.
	•	Assign client.
	•	Assign team member.
	•	Add address, date/time, notes, job status (New, Scheduled, In Progress, Completed).
	•	Status updates:
	•	Dashboard counts update correctly (e.g. “Open Jobs: 3”).
	•	Job view:
	•	Shows timeline (created, quote sent, invoice paid, etc.) if you’ve built it.
	•	Attachments (photos, PDFs) upload and display.

C. Quotes
	•	Create quote from:
	•	Jobs page (“Create Quote from job”)
	•	Or directly from Quotes tab.
	•	Line items:
	•	Qty, unit price, calculated line total.
	•	GST toggle (on/off).
	•	Total updates instantly.
	•	Quote number auto-increments (Q-1001, Q-1002…).
	•	Quote PDF:
	•	Uses your branding (TradieTrack logo + tradie’s logo if uploaded).
	•	Shows all required info (ABN, client, terms, expiry date).
	•	Email quote:
	•	Uses SendGrid.
	•	Goes to client’s email.
	•	Includes link + attached PDF.

D. Quote → Job → Invoice flow
	•	Accept quote (simulate client clicking accept):
	•	Quote status becomes “Accepted”.
	•	Job auto-created or linked.
	•	Create invoice from:
	•	Accepted quote OR completed job.
	•	Invoice PDF:
	•	Invoice number, due date, payment instructions, GST, totals.

E. Payments (Stripe)
	•	Connect a Stripe account in Settings:
	•	Test with Stripe test keys.
	•	From an invoice:
	•	“Pay Online” button leads to Stripe Checkout or Payment Link.
	•	After payment:
	•	Webhook (or polling) marks invoice “Paid”.
	•	Stores payment date, amount, method.
	•	You (Ayden) also have your own Stripe connection for TradieTrack subscriptions.

F. Email flows (SendGrid)

Test these:
	•	New account welcome email (to tradie).
	•	Quote sent email (to client).
	•	Invoice sent email (to client).
	•	Payment receipt (optional, nice to have).
Check:
	•	Subject lines are clear and non-spammy.
	•	From-name is something like:
	•	“Mike’s Plumbing via TradieTrack” or
	•	“TradieTrack on behalf of Mike’s Plumbing”.

3️⃣ Offline + Cloud Backend Checklist

You want:
	•	Cloud backend for real syncing
	•	Offline-friendly UI for when they’re on site

A. Architecture (conceptually)
	•	Frontend: your TradieTrack web app.
	•	Backend API: e.g. Node/Express, Supabase, Firebase, or Replit DB + wrappers.
	•	Database: Postgres / Supabase / Firebase Firestore / etc.
	•	Integrations:
	•	Stripe webhooks → your API → update invoices.
	•	SendGrid / Twilio email → your API for logs.

B. Offline behaviour

When internet goes off mid-job:
	1.	Detect offline
	•	Use navigator.onLine + window.addEventListener('online'/'offline').
	•	Show a small banner:
“Offline – changes will sync when connection returns.”
	2.	Queue actions locally
	•	Store unsynced actions in localStorage / IndexedDB:
	•	New job
	•	Job edits
	•	Photos (might need local caching)
	•	When back online:
	•	Replay the queue → send to API.
	•	Clear once successful.
	3.	What’s read-only when offline
	•	No new Stripe payments (obviously).
	•	No email sending.
	•	But:
	•	They can still open recently loaded jobs (cached).
	•	They can still create new jobs/notes which sync later.
	4.	Testing offline
	•	Open app in Chrome dev tools → toggle “Offline”.
	•	Try:
	•	Open a job (should use cache if possible).
	•	Create/edit a job.
	•	Turn back online → confirm data appears in database.

4️⃣ Master Replit Prompt – QA & UX Sweep

Here’s a prompt you can paste into Replit’s AI:

PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI
You are a senior SaaS product designer + QA engineer.
I have built a web app called TradieTrack – a job, quote and invoice management platform for Australian tradies (similar to ServiceM8 / Tradify).

I want you to:
	1.	Go through the entire app as if you are a tradie user (owner + worker).
	2.	Thoroughly test all workflows:
	•	Sign up, onboarding, business setup
	•	Creating / editing / deleting Jobs
	•	Creating Quotes (with line items, GST, totals, expiry)
	•	Sending Quotes via email (SendGrid) + PDF output
	•	Converting Quotes → Jobs → Invoices
	•	Creating + sending Invoices, marking as paid
	•	Stripe payments integration (test mode)
	•	Client management (add, edit, search, filter)
	•	Calendar / Today’s schedule
	•	File uploads/attachments for jobs
	•	Notifications / banners / error messages
	3.	Check UX & UI quality:
	•	Navigation clarity (bottom nav, side panels, back buttons)
	•	Consistent spacing, typography, card styles, button hierarchy
	•	Empty states for all lists (Jobs, Quotes, Invoices, Clients)
	•	Error states and loading skeletons
	•	Mobile responsiveness (iPhone-sized viewport)
	4.	Check offline behaviour conceptually:
	•	Identify what currently breaks when offline
	•	Suggest how to add local caching + action queue for Jobs/Notes
	5.	Compare UX quality to apps like ServiceM8 / Tradify and list:
	•	What feels on-par
	•	What feels weaker or missing
	•	Concrete improvements I should make before beta release

When you’re done, give me:
	•	A bug list (with steps to reproduce)
	•	A UX issues list (with suggested fixes)
	•	A feature gaps list vs pro-tier tradie apps
	•	A final “beta readiness” verdict (YES/ALMOST/NO) with next steps.

⸻

5️⃣ What you actually do next
	1.	Run through my checklists yourself on your phone + laptop.
	2.	Paste the Replit prompt and get its feedback.
	3.	Fix:
	•	Any broken flows
	•	Any confusing UX
	•	Any places where totals/logic feel off
	4.	Once you’re happy:
	•	Turn on real domain
	•	Lock in pricing
	•	Invite your first 3 beta tradies.

If you want, next time you can send me screens of each main screen (Dashboard, Jobs, Job Details, Quote editor, Invoice editor) and I’ll do a pixel-level UX critique like a real product designer.
