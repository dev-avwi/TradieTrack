Here it is — **your Real-World Testing Script** written exactly the way a QA engineer + real tradie would test TradieTrack **in the field using 2 phones**.

This is **not** a code-testing prompt.
This is a **physical, hands-on, real-life simulation** so you know your app will work in Cairns with an actual tradie before launch.

This script will reveal all UX gaps, backend bugs, and “UI only” features.

# 🔥 **REAL-WORLD FIELD TESTING SCRIPT (Use your phone + another phone)**

## 📱 **Setup for the test**

You need:

* Your phone (acting as *Owner / Admin*)
* A second device (phone or laptop) acting as *Tradie*
* A suburb you can walk around (or simulate by switching WiFi hotspots)

This script assumes:

Owner = You
Tradie = a test account you create
Team = you + tradie

# 🟦 **1️⃣ TEST: Real Job Creation → Map → Team Visibility**

### **Step 1 — Owner creates a job**

On Owner phone:

1. Add Job
   **Job:** “Blocked drain – McLeod St”
   **Client:** Sarah Thompson
   **Address:** 21 McLeod St, Cairns North
   **Status:** New
   **Assign to:** Test Tradie #1

2. Save job

### Expected:

* Job instantly appears under “Jobs”
* Job appears on the **Map screen**
* Job pin shows STATUS (“New”)

**If not → Map backend or geocoding missing.**

---

# 🟦 **2️⃣ TEST: GPS Position of Tradie Live on Map**

On Tradie phone:

1. Log in with the tradie account
2. Go to “Team Map” or “Location Share” page
3. Enable location sharing (or simulate)

   * Walk outside OR
   * Turn location on and off OR
   * Change WiFi networks to simulate movement

### Expected:

* Owner map shows tradie moving or updating position
* Tradie has a **badge**: “Available” or “En Route”

**Broken sign?**
→ Websocket listener or API route not implemented.

---

# 🟦 **3️⃣ TEST: Owner assigns job → Tradie receives notification**

On Owner phone:

1. Assign job to Tradie #1
2. Set start time (e.g. “Today 3:15pm”)

On Tradie phone:

### Expected:

* Notification (in-app + email ideally)
* Job appears in “My Jobs”
* Job appears on map with their icon

---

# 🟦 **4️⃣ TEST: Job Discussion (Team Chat + Job Chat)**

## A) Team Chat

Owner:
“Hey mate, can you head to McLeod St now?”

Tradie:
“Yep, on the way.”

### Expected:

* Messages deliver instantly (websockets)
* Typing indicators optional
* Chat persists across refresh
* No duplicated messages

**If messages appear twice → duplicate event handler.**
**If messages vanish on refresh → backend not storing chat.**

---

## B) Job-Specific Chat

Owner posts in **Job Chat**:

“Client said the drain backs up when shower runs.”

Tradie replies:

“Copy that. Will check S-bend.”

Expected:

* Job chat is separate from team chat
* Messages attach to correct job
* Persist in Job Activity Log

---

# 🟦 **5️⃣ TEST: Quote → Email → Client Gmail → Accept → Back into App**

### Step 1 — Owner creates quote

* Labour: 1.5 hrs @ $110/hr
* Part: Drain cleaner – $35
* GST ON
* Total auto-calculated
* PDF preview shows live updates

### Step 2 — Send quote

Send to **your +client Gmail**.

### Step 3 — Check in Gmail (on your real phone)

Email must show:

* Subject: “Quote from Cairns Coast Plumbing”
* Logo (if Pro)
* PDF OR clean web-view link
* CTAs: **Accept | Ask a question**

### Step 4 — Accept quote (as client)

Expected:

✔ Quote status changes to **Accepted**
✔ Job status auto-changes to **Approved**
✔ Activity feed logs “Sarah accepted quote at 2:42 PM”

---

# 🟦 **6️⃣ TEST: Invoice → Stripe Payment → Receipt**

Owner:

1. Convert quote → Invoice
2. Send invoice (email)
3. Check PDF looks professional

Client (on another device):

1. Open invoice
2. Hit “Pay Now”
3. Use Stripe test card 4242 4242 4242 4242
4. Complete payment

Expected in Owner view:

✔ Invoice status: **Paid**
✔ Payment reference stored
✔ “Payment received email” goes to client
✔ Job moves to **Completed** (optional automation)

---

# 🟦 **7️⃣ TEST: Location Tracking On-Site**

Tradie goes to real driveway/street OR simulate via map.

Tradie:

* Opens job
* Taps “On Site”
* App stores real coordinates
* Timer starts (“Time tracking”)

Owner:

* Sees “Tradie on site @ 3:09 PM”
* Map shows tradie pinned at job
* Timer running in real-time

Tradie:

* Presses “Complete”
* Adds photos
* Notes
* Timer stops

Owner:

✔ Receives completion event
✔ Notes + photos attached
✔ Job marked completed

If any of this fails → backend missing.

---

# 🟦 **8️⃣ TEST: Map Review Page (Job History + Icons)**

Owner opens **Map → Past Jobs**:

Expected:

* Completed jobs appear as grey pins
* Scheduled jobs are blue
* Urgent jobs (if exists) are red
* Tapping a pin opens job summary
* Clusters show if many in same suburb
* Filter by “My Jobs”, “Team”, “This Week”

If pins are missing:
→ geocoding or DB relationship missing
If wrong color:
→ status → pin-color mapping missing

---

# 🟦 **9️⃣ TEST: Team Communication Flow**

Owner sends message to tradie:

“Send me a photo of the drain before fixing.”

Tradie:

* Opens job
* Uploads 1–3 photos
* Sends message

Expected:

✔ Photos appear in Job Activity
✔ Photos load fast
✔ Thumbnails generate
✔ Can tap to enlarge

---

# 🟦 **🔟 TEST: Offline or Bad Connection**

On Tradie phone:

1. Turn on Airplane Mode
2. Try:

   * Open job
   * Add note
   * Mark on-site
   * Take photo

Expected:

* UI doesn’t crash
* Shows “No internet, will sync when online” OR
* Disables action

Then turn connection on again:

Expected:

* Sync runs
* Job updates
* No duplicate events

# 🔥 BONUS — FINAL TEST: Real tradie simulation

Perform this next time you’re in town.

* Owner stays in Cairns North
* Tradie stands in Edge Hill or Manunda
* Owner assigns job
* Tradie travels (walk, bike, car)
* You watch tradie move across the map
* Tradie marks on-site and completes job
* You approve and invoice
* You test Stripe payment
* You check activity log

If this works — your app is **ready for REAL tradies.**

If you want, I can also generate:

🧠 A “real tradie interview script” (what to ask testers)
🏷️ A “beta feedback form”
💳 Suggested pricing for beta testers
📣 A launch announcement for Cairns tradies
📱 A UI polish checklist before launch

Just tell me and I’ll build it.
