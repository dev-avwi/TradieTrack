You’re so close with this thing, it’s kinda wild. 🔥

I can’t literally click around or create users inside your app (no real browser / no direct access to your Replit project), but I *can*:

* Simulate exactly how an owner + manager + tradies should use it
* Give you a **step-by-step test script** you can run on your phone/laptop
* Give you a **Replit master prompt** that tells Replit AI to check team management, roles, map, and dispatch logic in the *code*, not just the UI

I’ll do both.

## 1️⃣ Real-world test script – “Owner + Manager + 2 Tradies + Map + Dispatch”

Run this yourself in the browser, like a real business.

### 👤 Step 1: Create the OWNER account (new business)

1. Go to your sign-up page.
2. Sign up as:

   * Name: **James Weber**
   * Business: **Weber Plumbing & Gas**
   * Email: your real email or +alias (e.g. `yourgmail+owner@gmail.com`)
   * Role: **Owner**
3. Complete onboarding:

   * Trade type: Plumbing
   * City: Cairns
   * Team size: 3–5
   * Choose “I have a team” (so it gives you owner dashboard, not solo view).

✅ Check:

* You land on **Owner dashboard**, not a generic one.
* You can see **billing**, **team**, **map**, **dispatch board**, **settings**.

---

### 👥 Step 2: Add a MANAGER + 2 TRADIES

From the Owner account, go to **Team / Users**:

Create 3 users:

1. **Manager**

   * Name: *Emily Ross*
   * Role: **Manager**
   * Email: `yourgmail+manager@gmail.com`

2. **Tradie 1**

   * Name: *Liam Harris*
   * Role: **Tradie**
   * Email: `yourgmail+tradie1@gmail.com`

3. **Tradie 2**

   * Name: *Noah Clark*
   * Role: **Tradie**
   * Email: `yourgmail+tradie2@gmail.com`

✅ Check:

* Each invite/link works.
* They can log in.
* Their dashboards look different (Owner vs Manager vs Tradie).

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Test **permissions per role**

Open 3 browser windows or devices:

* Window 1: Owner (James)
* Window 2: Manager (Emily)
* Window 3: Tradie 1 (Liam)

Test this table:

| Action                               | Owner |  Manager |               Tradie              |
| ------------------------------------ | :---: | :------: | :-------------------------------: |
| See ALL jobs                         |   ✅   |     ✅    |            ❌ (only own)           |
| Edit business settings               |   ✅   | ⚠️ maybe |                 ❌                 |
| Manage billing/subscription          |   ✅   |     ❌    |                 ❌                 |
| Add/remove team members              |   ✅   | ⚠️ maybe |                 ❌                 |
| Create jobs                          |   ✅   |     ✅    | ❌ or ✅ (depending on your design) |
| Assign jobs to tradies               |   ✅   |     ✅    |                 ❌                 |
| Change job status (for any job)      |   ✅   |     ✅    |       ✅ (only assigned jobs)      |
| See dispatch/map with all jobs       |   ✅   |     ✅    |           ❌ or only own           |
| Send messages in **team chat**       |   ✅   |     ✅    |                 ✅                 |
| DM a tradie (owner/manager → tradie) |   ✅   |     ✅    |      ⚠️ maybe no DM to owner      |

If anything doesn’t match how you *want* it to behave, write that down.

### 🗺️ Step 4: Map + Dispatch – jobs across Cairns

As the **Owner**:

1. Create 4 jobs in different suburbs:

   * Job 1: “Hot water issue” – **Edge Hill**
   * Job 2: “Blocked drain” – **Earlville**
   * Job 3: “Bathroom reno quote” – **Redlynch**
   * Job 4: “Leaking kitchen sink” – **Trinity Beach**

2. Assign:

   * Job 1 → **Liam (Tradie 1)**
   * Job 2 → **Liam**
   * Job 3 → **Noah (Tradie 2)**
   * Job 4 → **Noah**

3. Go to the **Map / Dispatch** page.

✅ Check (Owner view):

* All 4 jobs show as pins across a Cairns-style map.
* Clicking a pin shows:

  * Job title
  * Status (New / Scheduled / In progress / Complete)
  * Assigned tradie

Then log in as:

* Manager: should see same map + jobs.
* Tradie 1: should see only **their jobs** (Job 1 & 2).
* Tradie 2: only **theirs** (Job 3 & 4).

Change statuses:

* Owner / Manager:

  * Drag jobs on the dispatch board to different times/days (if you have drag+drop).
  * Change Job 1 → **In Progress**, Job 2 → **Completed**.
* Tradie 1:

  * On their phone, open Job 2 and mark as **Completed**.
  * Add photos and time tracking.

✅ Map should update pin color / status badge for those jobs for *all* roles.

---

### ⏱️ Step 5: Time tracking + location per job

For **Job 1 – Hot water issue**:

As **Tradie 1 (Liam)** on your phone:

1. Open Job 1.
2. Tap **“Start time tracking”** when you “arrive”.
3. If you have a **“Use current location”** button:

   * Tap it to capture GPS → job location.
4. Do a fake workflow:

   * Add 2–3 notes (“Customer said hot water intermittent”, etc.).
   * Add 1–2 photos.
   * After a couple of minutes, tap **“Stop time tracking”**.

✅ Then as Owner:

* Check Job 1 detail:

  * Time entries show up (start/end/duration).
  * Location appears (address / map link).
  * Notes & photos are visible.
* On **Map / Dispatch**:

  * Job 1 pin location matches the address.
  * If you show “Last known tradie location”, check it updates.

---

### 💬 Step 6: Team chat + job chat

1. As Owner, open **Team Chat**:

   * Send: “Morning team, today’s jobs are live in TradieTrack 👍”
2. As Manager: reply.
3. As each tradie: reply with a quick “Seen 👍”.

✅ Check:

* Messages show in correct order.
* Names/avatars/roles look right.
* No one sees chats they shouldn’t (e.g. private owner/manager discussion).

4. Now test **Job chat**:

   * On Job 3, send a message as Owner:

     > “Noah, make sure to take before/after photos for this reno quote.”
   * As **Noah (Tradie 2)**, reply in the job chat.

✅ Check:

* Job chat is tied to that job only.
* Owner sees messages in job view + maybe in an “Activity/Recent” feed.
* Tradie 1 **cannot** see Job 3 chat.

---

### 🧾 Step 7: End-to-end real workflow

Pick **Job 4 – Leaking kitchen sink** and run it fully:

1. Owner creates job.
2. Assigns to Tradie 2.
3. Tradie 2:

   * Starts time tracking.
   * Adds notes & photos.
   * Marks job as **Completed**.
4. Owner:

   * Creates **Quote** from job → sends to client.
   * Client (your +alias email) accepts quote.
   * Owner converts quote → **Invoice**.
   * Sends invoice → pays via Stripe test card.
5. Invoice moves to **Paid** status.
6. Job shows as **Completed & Paid** in dispatch map and dashboard.

If that works smoothly, this is honestly already “real-world ready”.

## 2️⃣ Replit master prompt – focus on team roles + map + dispatch + chat

Here’s a single prompt you can paste into Replit AI so it checks the *code* for everything you just tested manually:

> **REPLIT MASTER PROMPT – TEAM ROLES + MAP + DISPATCH + CHAT (TRADIETRACK)**
>
> I’m building TradieTrack, a SaaS app for tradies (jobs, quotes, invoices, map, dispatch, team roles, and chat).
>
> I want you to act as:
>
> * a backend QA engineer
> * a frontend/UX reviewer
> * and a product tester focused on **team management + maps + dispatch + chat**.
>
> Your job:
> **Make sure nothing is “UI only” and all the team + map features actually work end-to-end in the code.**
>
> Please go through the entire codebase and do the following:
>
> 1️⃣ **Understand and verify the data model (roles + jobs + locations + chat)**
>
> Find the models/tables for:
>
> * users
> * businesses
> * roles/permissions (owner, manager, tradie)
> * jobs
> * job assignments (who is assigned to which job)
> * job locations (address, lat, lng)
> * job status (new, scheduled, in-progress, completed, invoiced, paid)
> * messages (team chat + job chat)
>
> Check and, if needed, improve:
>
> * relationships between these models
> * that every job belongs to a business
> * that every user belongs to a business and has a role
> * that messages are linked to either a business (team chat) or job (job chat)
>
> 2️⃣ **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
>
> For all API routes, server functions, and UI pages related to:
>
> * Team / Users
> * Jobs
> * Map / Dispatch
> * Chat
>
> Confirm:
>
> * **Owner** can:
>
>   * see all jobs for their business
>   * manage team members (create/update/remove users + roles)
>   * see & edit business settings and billing
>   * see full map/dispatch view with all jobs
> * **Manager** can:
>
>   * see all jobs for their business
>   * assign jobs to tradies
>   * update job statuses
>   * see full map/dispatch view
>   * NOT change billing or subscription
>   * NOT remove the owner
> * **Tradie** can:
>
>   * only see jobs assigned to them
>   * see their own jobs on the map/dispatch view
>   * update status/time tracking/notes/photos for their jobs
>   * NOT manage team members or billing
>   * NOT see other tradies’ jobs unless explicitly allowed
>
> If any route or component allows a tradie to access data they shouldn’t, **tighten the checks** (e.g. by checking `user.role` and `job.business_id`).
>
> 3️⃣ **Map & job location system**
>
> Make sure the map and job locations are fully implemented:
>
> * On job create/update:
>
>   * Save job address to the database.
>   * If geocoding is used, store `lat` + `lng`.
> * On the **Map/Dispatch** page:
>
>   * Jobs are loaded from the backend with correct position (lat/lng or geocoded address).
>   * Pins are rendered with:
>
>     * job title
>     * status
>     * assigned tradie
> * If there is a “Use current location” or “Track location” feature:
>
>   * Confirm it calls a real function and that location data is stored in the backend (e.g. last known location for tradie or job).
>   * If it’s not fully implemented, hide it or mark it clearly as “coming soon” for beta.
> * Make sure:
>
>   * Owner and Manager see ALL jobs on the map.
>   * Tradies see only their own jobs or a filtered subset according to their role.
>
> 4️⃣ **Dispatch board (time + assignment)**
>
> If there is a dispatch/schedule board:
>
> * Verify that drag-and-drop (if implemented) updates:
>
>   * job scheduled date/time
>   * assigned tradie (if dragged to another column or lane)
> * Confirm these updates persist in the database and are visible:
>
>   * on the jobs list
>   * on the map
>   * in each tradie’s view
>
> If dispatch UI exists but backend logic is incomplete, either:
>
> * complete the backend implementation, OR
> * hide/disable those controls for beta.
>
> 5️⃣ **Team chat and job chat**
>
> Find the implementation for:
>
> * team-wide chat channels (business chat)
> * job-specific chat (comments/messages tied to a job)
>
> Confirm:
>
> * Messages are stored with:
>
>   * sender user ID
>   * business ID
>   * job ID (for job chat) or null (for general/team chat)
>   * timestamp
> * Team chat:
>
>   * Only users from the same business can see messages.
>   * All roles (owner, manager, tradie) can send messages.
> * Job chat:
>
>   * Only the owner, managers, and assigned tradies can see messages.
>   * Messages appear on the job detail view.
>
> Make sure no chat components are “fake” UI without proper backend calls.
>
> 6️⃣ **Status changes, time tracking, and their impact**
>
> For job status and time tracking:
>
> * Ensure that:
>
>   * status updates are sent to the backend and persisted
>   * time tracking entries (start, stop, duration) are saved with a job and user reference
> * Map and dispatch should reflect:
>
>   * job status (e.g. different pin colours or labels)
>   * jobs in progress vs completed
>
> Double-check that:
>
> * marking a job as **Completed** doesn’t break any flows
> * completion can be used later to filter or report jobs
>
> 7️⃣ **UI/UX sanity for team + map**
>
> On the frontend, review:
>
> * Owner dashboard:
>
>   * Shows overview of today’s jobs, statuses, and team activity
>   * Has clear entry points to Map/Dispatch and Team management
> * Manager view:
>
>   * Similar tools but without billing controls
> * Tradie view:
>
>   * Focused on “My jobs today”, simple layout
>   * Easy access to job details, map directions, time tracking, and job chat
> * Map/Dispatch:
>
>   * Works well on desktop and is readable on mobile
>   * No huge unused white columns
>
> Ensure labels are tradie-friendly (e.g. “New job”, “On the way”, “On site”, “Completed”), not developer jargon.
>
> 8️⃣ **Flag any half-finished features**
>
> As you scan the code, identify:
>
> * components with TODOs
> * routes that return dummy data
> * unfinished implementations for map, dispatch, team, or chat
>
> For anything that is visible in the UI but not actually implemented:
>
> * either finish the backend logic, OR
> * temporarily hide or mark as “coming soon” so real tradies don’t think it’s broken.
>
> 9️⃣ **Final summary**
>
> At the end, provide (in comments or console output):
>
> * ✅ Which team+map+dispatch+chat flows are fully working
> * ⚠️ Which ones are partial and should be labelled beta/coming soon
> * 🛠 Any critical security or permission issues found
> * 🎯 A short MUST-FIX list before I invite my first 3 real tradie teams
>
> Use my existing codebase as the source of truth and bring it to a **technically solid beta** where:
>
> * roles behave correctly
> * the map & dispatch system is functional
> * chat is stored and permissioned properly
> * no key feature is “UI only” with no backend.

If you run that prompt in Replit *and* you run through the manual test script on your phone with those mock users, you’ll be extremely close to knowing:

* ✅ Roles work
* ✅ Map + dispatch works
* ✅ Team chat + job chat works
* ✅ Nothing is half-done just for show
