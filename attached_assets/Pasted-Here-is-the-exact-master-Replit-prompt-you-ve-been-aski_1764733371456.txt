Here is **the exact master Replit prompt** you’ve been asking for — focused ONLY on **TradieTrack**, and built to:

✅ Compare your app directly to ServiceM8
✅ Check ALL workflows end-to-end
✅ Ensure onboarding creates correct roles (Solo vs Team Owner vs Tradie)
✅ Ensure the entire system is smart, connected, and production-ready
✅ Generate test accounts (Owner + Solo Tradie + Team Tradie)
✅ Confirm UX, UI, backend and integrations behave exactly like a real tradie needs

This is **the strongest technical QA prompt** you can paste into Replit to upgrade your codebase.

# 🧠 **REPLIT MASTER TESTING PROMPT — “ServiceM8-Level TradieTrack QA”**

**Paste this directly into Replit AI.**
Do NOT edit anything unless you want to add new features later.

---

## 🟦 **PURPOSE**

You are acting as a **full QA engineer**, **workflow analyst**, and **ServiceM8 feature comparator** for TradieTrack.

Your job is to make sure TradieTrack:

✔ Works in real tradie workflows
✔ Matches or exceeds ServiceM8 features
✔ Has no UI-only elements
✔ Has full backend logic for every major action
✔ Properly separates Owner vs Solo Tradie vs Team Tradie dashboards
✔ Generates correct PDFs, emails, jobs, payments, and chats
✔ Has correct location + time tracking
✔ Has a smart onboarding flow that configures the account correctly

# 1️⃣ **Create Test Accounts in the System (Very Important)**

Simulate these accounts IN THE CODE BASE and use them for all reasoning/testing:

### **A) Team Owner Account**

```
Name: Mike Sullivan  
Business: North QLD Plumbing & Gas  
Role: Owner  
Plan: Pro  
Staff: 3 techs
Location: Cairns, QLD  
```

### **B) Solo Tradie Account**

```
Name: Luke Harris  
Business: Harris Electrical  
Role: Solo  
Plan: Free  
Location: Cairns, QLD  
```

### **C) Team Tradie Account**

```
Name: Tom Nguyen  
Business: North QLD Plumbing & Gas  
Role: Technician  
Plan: Inherits Owner’s Pro  
```

Use these 3 personas throughout every test.
Simulate each one logging in and experiencing their dashboard EXACTLY like a real tradie.

# 2️⃣ **Onboarding Flow Must Branch Correctly**

Verify onboarding screens:

### **Owner onboarding should ask:**

* Business name
* ABN
* Address
* Phone
* Team size
* Invite staff emails
* Logo upload
* Preferred job categories
* Stripe Connect setup (optional)
* Default schedule templates
  ❗ Confirm these create correct database entries.

### **Solo onboarding should ask:**

* Business name
* ABN (optional for sole traders)
* Logo (optional)
* Basic job preferences
  ❗ Should NOT show team/roles settings.

---

# 3️⃣ **Dashboard Separation (MUST BE WORKING)**

Check all code paths:

### **Owner dashboard must show:**

* Team locations on map
* Job status counts
* Financial summary
* Staff performance (completed jobs, overdue jobs)
* Group chat & Direct messages
* Quotes requiring approval
* Payments received
* Overdue invoices

### **Solo dashboard must show:**

* Today’s jobs
* Overdue invoices
* Quick actions
* AI assistant
  ❗ No team buttons, no staff map, no invites.

### **Team Tradie dashboard must show:**

* Assigned jobs only
* Location tracking button ("Start job", "On-site")
* Chat with Owner
* Upload photos/files for each job

---

# 4️⃣ **Map System (ServiceM8 comparison)**

Verify TradieTrack map is fully functional:

### MUST test in code:

* Each job has stored address
* Geocode → stores lat/lng
* Map clusters jobs across a region
* Job pins show status color (Scheduled, In-progress, Completed)
* Owner location shows
* Team Tradie location shows
* LIVE updates every 10–30 sec

### If location tracking not fully implemented:

→ Hide behind `"coming soon"` toggle

---

# 5️⃣ **Job Workflow — ServiceM8 Level**

Test these steps:

### **Owner creates job → Assigned tradie gets notification**

Confirm:

* Job saved
* Push notification event created
* Tradie dashboard updates
* Appears on map
* Correct job number assigned

### **Tradie marks themselves on-site**

Confirm:

* Location saved (lat/lng + timestamp)
* Job status updates
* Time tracking starts

### **Tradie uploads photos**

Confirm:

* Saved to cloud storage
* Visible to owner
* Attaches to final invoice/report

### **Owner marks job completed**

Confirm:

* Close-out timestamp
* Time tracking stops
* Auto-create invoice draft

---

# 6️⃣ **Quotes & Invoices — Must Match ServiceM8 Quality**

COMPARE AGAINST SERVICEM8 SPEC:

PDFs MUST include:

* Logo (Pro users)
* ABN
* Client info
* Job info
* Line items
* GST breakdown
* Total
* Footer with terms
* Invoice number
* Issue + due date

Email MUST include:

* Nice subject
* Reply-To tradie's email
* Clean template
* Link to PDF OR attached PDF

❗ Ensure PDFs are NOT “UI screenshots” — must use PDF generator code.

---

# 7️⃣ **Payments (Stripe)**

### **Test Stripe for:**

1. TradieTrack subscription payments
2. Client → Tradie invoice payments

Confirm:

* Test mode works
* Webhooks update status
* Paid invoices cannot be edited
* Payment receipts generated

---

# 8️⃣ **Chat System (Team Chat + Direct Messages)**

Test:

* Owner ↔ Tradie 1:1 chat
* Group chat
* File upload (images/documents)
* Real-time updates via sockets/polling

Ensure:

* Messages saved in DB
* Notifications triggered
* Only team members see team chats

---

# 9️⃣ **Time Tracking**

Tradie:

* Starts job
* Ends job
* Breaks
* Auto-stops when job completed

Owner:

* Sees full timesheet
* Approves hours
* Export to PDF/CSV

Ensure all DB logic exists.
