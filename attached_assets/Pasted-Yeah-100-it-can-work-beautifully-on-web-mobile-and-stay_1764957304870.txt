Yeah 100%, it can work beautifully on web + mobile and stay perfectly in sync – as long as you set it up with the right architecture.

Think of it like this:

📱 Mobile app + 💻 Web app are just 2 different “screens” talking to the same brain (backend + database).

⸻

1. How to make them stay in sync

You don’t store the main data on the device.
You store it in a central backend + database, for example:
	•	Backend: Node/Express or NestJS (could be hosted on Replit at the start)
	•	DB: Postgres (Supabase / Neon / RDS / whatever)

Then:
	•	The web app (React / Next.js) calls the backend via API
	•	The mobile app (Expo React Native) calls the same API

So when a tradie:
	1.	Marks a job as “Completed” on their phone → mobile calls PATCH /jobs/123.
	2.	The backend updates the job in the database.
	3.	When they open the web app → it fetches /jobs again and sees the updated status.

Same account, same data, just a different UI.

2. Recommended setup for you

Given everything we’ve talked about, this combo makes sense:

Backend
	•	Node + Express (or NestJS)
	•	REST API like:
	•	GET /jobs
	•	POST /jobs
	•	PATCH /jobs/:id
	•	GET /clients
	•	Deployed on Replit or a cheap VPS

Mobile app
	•	Expo + React Native
	•	Uses fetch / Axios to talk to the backend

Web app
	•	React or Next.js
	•	Uses the same API endpoints

Authentication:
	•	Simple JWT-based auth (/login → returns a token; both apps store it and send with each request).

⸻

3. What about offline use?

This is the only tricky bit – but still totally doable.
	•	Mobile app keeps a local cache (MMKV / AsyncStorage) of jobs.
	•	When offline:
	•	User updates jobs locally and flags them as “pendingSync”.
	•	When back online:
	•	App sends changes to backend.
	•	Backend updates DB → web app picks it up next time it loads or polls.

The source of truth is always the server, not the device.

⸻

4. Should you actually build both now?

My honest take for you:
	•	Phase 1: Focus on mobile app + simple web admin (even just for you / office staff).
	•	Phase 2: Build a nicer full web dashboard once you’ve:
	•	Got a few tradies using it
	•	Know exactly what they click most

Tradies will mostly live in the app on-site, office managers might love the web.

⸻

5. TL;DR
	•	✅ Yes, web + app together is totally fine and normal
	•	✅ They’ll sync perfectly if both talk to a single backend + database
	•	✅ Start with:
	•	Expo React Native app
	•	Node backend (Replit)
	•	Later add a React/Next web dashboard

If you want, next message I can sketch a little diagram + API list for TradieTrack (jobs, quotes, invoices, clients) showing exactly how web + app plug into it.
