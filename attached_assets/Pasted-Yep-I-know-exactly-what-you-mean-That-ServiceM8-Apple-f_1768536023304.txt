Yep — I know exactly what you mean. That “ServiceM8 / Apple” feel is basically:
	•	iOS-native navigation patterns (tab bar + large titles + sheets)
	•	translucent materials (blur/vibrancy = the “Liquid Glass” look)
	•	soft separators, grouped cards, subtle motion
	•	perfect spacing + safe areas
	•	haptics + micro-animations

Apple literally describes this as using materials (blur, vibrancy, blending) to show structure in content beneath “Liquid Glass.”  ￼

And good news: you can get very close in TradieTrack (Expo/React Native) without rewriting everything native.

⸻

What to change in TradieTrack (high impact)

1) Switch navigation to “iOS app” style

Instead of “website pages in a sidebar” on mobile, use:
	•	Bottom Tab Bar for the 4–5 main areas (Today, Jobs, Quotes, Invoices, More)
	•	Stack screens for details (Job Detail, Quote Preview, Create Invoice)
	•	Large title headers on top-level screens

That’s how the big iOS-feeling apps behave.

2) Make the nav surfaces “Liquid Glass”

Use BlurView for:
	•	Tab bar background
	•	Top header background
	•	Floating action bars (like ServiceM8’s job actions bar concept)  ￼

Expo has expo-blur’s BlurView specifically for blurring content underneath nav bars/tab bars/modals.  ￼

3) Use iOS “grouped” layouts

ServiceM8’s feel comes from:
	•	grouped sections
	•	rounded cards
	•	subtle dividers
	•	minimal borders
	•	spacing > lines

So: fewer hard borders, more “cards” and “grouped lists”.

4) Motion + haptics (small but huge)
	•	Haptic on primary actions (Send Quote, Mark Paid)
	•	Smooth sheet transitions (modals)
	•	Tiny bounce on buttons
This is what makes it feel premium.

⸻

Important reality check (so you don’t get stuck)

If you want it to “auto-adapt” like those App Store icons/backgrounds: that’s not the icon adapting—iOS is adding its own system effects (shadows, rounding, sometimes wallpaper contrast). Your job is to make sure your icon has:
	•	solid shape
	•	good padding
	•	no weird edge halo

(You’re already close.)

Paste this into Replit (Master “Liquid Glass + iOS UI” implementation prompt)

REPLIT PROMPT (copy/paste):

Upgrade TradieTrack (mobile + web where applicable) to a premium iOS “Liquid Glass” style like ServiceM8:

Goal: It must feel like a top-tier iOS app (tab-based, large titles, glass materials, smooth motion), not a website in an app shell.

A) Navigation overhaul (mobile)
	1.	Convert mobile navigation to: Bottom Tabs (Today, Jobs, Quotes, Invoices, More) + Stack screens for detail/edit flows.
	2.	Use iOS-style headers with large titles on top-level tabs.
	3.	Ensure consistent navigation between web and mobile: same information architecture, but mobile uses tabs not sidebar.

B) Liquid Glass materials
	1.	Use BlurView (expo-blur) for:
	•	tab bar background
	•	top header background when scrolling (sticky translucent header)
	•	floating action bar on job detail (quick actions)
	2.	Add subtle translucency + vibrancy (content visible under blur).
	3.	Ensure performance: avoid blurring huge full-screen surfaces; blur only nav surfaces and small overlays.

C) iOS “grouped” UI components

Replace harsh borders with:
	•	grouped sections
	•	rounded cards
	•	subtle separators
	•	consistent spacing system (8/12/16/24)
Create reusable components:
	•	GroupedSection
	•	SettingsRow
	•	Card
	•	FloatingActionBar

D) Micro-interactions
	•	Add haptics on primary actions (Send Quote, Accept Quote, Mark Paid, Start Timer).
	•	Use smooth modal/sheet transitions.
	•	Add loading skeletons for lists.

E) Theme + system adaptation
	•	Respect iOS light/dark mode automatically.
	•	Ensure text contrast meets accessibility.
	•	Icons use a consistent set (fix any invalid icon names like “palette” in Feather).

F) Deliverables
	1.	Implement the new tab navigation + glass tab bar.
	2.	Implement glass headers on main screens.
	3.	Update Jobs list + Job detail to iOS grouped layout with a floating actions bar.
	4.	Provide before/after screenshots and list every file changed.

If you tell me what you’re using for UI right now (NativeWind? Tamagui? React Native Paper? custom?), I’ll tailor the exact component approach so Replit can implement it with minimal rewrites.
