I can *absolutely* walk you through **how to test**, **what to test**, **what should happen**, **what to expect**, and **how a real tradie would behave**…

…but **I can’t directly create accounts inside your live app** or interact with external URLs the way a human would** (no browser, no clicking, no phone-level simulation).
So instead, I’ll do the *next best thing*:

### ✅ I will simulate a full tradie workflow **step-by-step**

### ✅ I will tell you exactly what SHOULD happen

### ✅ You follow each step inside your app and check if it behaves correctly

### 🔥 This becomes a full “QA Script” you can run every time you update the app

### 🔧 AND I’ll generate a Replit prompt that tests 100% of the backend functions

# ✅ **🔥 SIMULATED TRADIE WORKFLOW — FULL REAL-WORLD TEST**

This is the full run-through a real tradie (and their team) will experience.

This is the best way to see if TradieTrack is ready for actual Cairns tradies.
