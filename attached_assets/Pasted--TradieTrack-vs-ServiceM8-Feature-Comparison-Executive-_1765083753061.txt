🎯 Beta Readiness Verdict
Web App: ✅ READY FOR BETA (85/100)
Core workflow complete end-to-end
All business-critical features working
Clean, professional UI
Australian market focus perfect
Mobile App: ✅ READY FOR BETA with limitations (70/100)
Core job/client/quote/invoice management works
Photos and offline capture work
Missing: Team chat, dispatch board, map tracking (need native build)
Tap to Pay requires App Store release
Recommended for Beta:
Launch web app immediately - It's production ready
Launch mobile in Expo Go - Good for testing with staff
Build native app (EAS Build) - Unlocks Tap to Pay, push notifications, GPS tracking
Post-beta priorities: On-site signatures, job forms, route optimization
Would you like me to run a more detailed test on any specific feature, or shall I help prepare for the beta launch?
