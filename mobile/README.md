## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js 18+
2. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. Download **Expo Go** app on your phone (iOS App Store / Google Play)

```bash
# Navigate to mobile directory
cd mobile

# Install dependencies
npm install

**Note**: Some features require a native build:
- Tap to Pay (NFC) - requires EAS Build
- Background location - requires native permissions
- Push notifications - work in Expo Go but need native build for production
